# exegenius task 0020-write-recursive-saving

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/B4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Recursive power saving from rank deficit
Gloss: A call at parameter m·f uses s < W·m calls at parameter f on volume V/W, so normalized cost grows by factor s/W < m per level, giving cost V·(parameter)^{τ} with τ < 1.

## This page in the argument

The step: A call at parameter $mf$ uses $s<Wm$ calls at parameter $f$ on volume $V/W$, giving cost $V\cdot(\text{parameter})^{\tau}$ with $\tau<1$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- There is a deterministic fixed multitape Turing machine multiplying $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two fast tape procedures, use them for synthetic and resampled transforms, and assemble the exact product through convolution (on [Multiplication in O(n (lg n)^{1-κ}) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures, an address interchange of cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ and a simultaneous butterfly layer of cost $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, exist for volume $V$ with fixed $\tau,\lambda'<1$.; how: build both from fixed linear networks with a rank saving, applied recursively

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Subset-intersection subspace labels](subset-intersection-labels.md): Nested subspaces spanned by tensor products of three-element-subset indicator vectors (Frankl–Wilson/Alon style), giving a network whose total edge rank s is less than W·m.
  Shown as: Recursive power saving from rank deficit *<predicate>* Subset-intersection subspace labels

## Pages that build on this one

- Fast interchange of address chunks: Interchanging two contiguous address fields of u bits in a Cartesian-product array, by XOR/shear combinations through the bit network, at cost O(V u^τ) for fixed τ < 1.
- Simultaneous butterfly layer: Applying H₀ at the same bit position of up to d address chunks at once on records of complex fixed-point polynomials, using the complex phase network, at cost O(V d^λ′).

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "This strict inequality
is the source of the power saving." (paper)

  > A recursive call at parameter $mf$ therefore uses $s$ calls at parameter $f$, each on a stream of volume $V/W$. The parameter counts field digits for address interchange and selected axes for a numerical layer. After dividing cost by volume, multiplying the parameter by $m$ increases the recursive contribution by $s/W<m$. This strict inequality is the source of the power saving. The later tape and arithmetic estimates preserve it, including the work of changing numerical address coordinates. Those changes are implemented by whole-chunk moves and controlled shifts, followed by a deterministic correction of the explicitly identified exceptional addresses.
