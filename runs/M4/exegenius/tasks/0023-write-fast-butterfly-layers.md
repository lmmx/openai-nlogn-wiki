# exegenius task 0023-write-fast-butterfly-layers

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/M4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Fast simultaneous butterfly layers
Gloss: Applying the butterfly map to the same bit of up to d address chunks at once on numerical arrays, at cost O(V d^λ') with λ'<1.

## This page in the argument

The step: The map $H_0$ can be applied to the same bit of up to $d$ address chunks of an array of volume $V$ at once, at cost $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$.
How: obtain the simultaneous layer as the endpoint operator of a phase network under frames, with recursion on the number of selected axes and the address changes done by the fast interchange
Why: The same network-plus-recursion saving as for address interchange applies, with the parameter counting selected axes instead of field digits. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$, the simultaneous layer of $H_0$ with one truncation, in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time, $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce the product through a chain of changes of representation down to convolution over a polynomial ring, speed up the transforms with two tape procedures, then recover the exact integer (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-multiplication.md))
- Address rearrangement of a stored array of volume $V$ and the butterfly layers of the transforms can each be done in time $O(V f^{\theta})$ for a fixed $\theta<1$ in the parameter $f$, instead of linear in $f$.; how: build each procedure from a fixed linear network applied on role arrays under frames, then use a recursive call that makes $s<Wm$ smaller calls to get a power saving

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S2.5.1). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S2.5.1**: The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$, the simultaneous layer of $H_0$ with one truncation, in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time.
Source: "The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in the same array," (paper)
> The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in the same array, coefficient order, and component format in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time, uniformly over all these choices of $p,d,r,D,P,S,\rho,w$ and $z$. Every returned coefficient belongs to the complex unit disk, and, in the maximum coefficient norm, \[ \|Q_p(\mathcal H z)-\mathcal H z\|_\infty <\sqrt2\,2^{-p}. \] The procedure evaluates the entire layer exactly before this final truncation. Put \[ C_0=128m\bigl(s_{\rm c}+64(W_{\rm c}+m+1)^3\bigr)^2, \] where $m,W_{\rm c},s_{\rm c}$ are the fixed constants of Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface}. The procedure uses at most $p+\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil$ fractional bits and $\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil+3$ integer and sign bits per real component internally; these widths are $O(p)$. The time includes address changes, deterministic repair, row padding and its removal, and fixed-tape workspace cleanup. Its tape count is fixed, and its time constant is independent of the allowed array lengths and coefficient values. \end{proposition}

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays." (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.

- "We will obtain cost $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with" (paper)

  > The parameters will satisfy \[ d=\Theta(p^\epsilon),\qquad K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor, \qquad r=2^{\Theta(p/d)},\qquad c>0,\quad 0<\epsilon<1. \] The exponents and comparison constants are fixed, and we impose their further restrictions in Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer}. Two consequences explain the layout. The polynomial length $r$ grows faster than every fixed power of $p$, so a scan of a record pays for polynomial work on its address. Also $K/\log p\to\infty$, which will make the exceptional set in a packed change of address bits small enough to repair by sorting. We will obtain cost $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with $\lambda'<1$ and $V$ the logical bit volume, whereas separate butterfly factors would require $D$ whole-array passes.

- "Simultaneous normalized butterfly layer" (paper)

  > \begin{proposition}[Simultaneous normalized butterfly layer] \label{prop:simultaneous-layer} Fix \[ \tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50},\qquad \beta=\frac12,\qquad C_1=20. \] Let $c,\epsilon,\lambda,\lambda'$ be fixed positive rational numbers satisfying \[ \max\{\tau,\sigma\}<\lambda<1,\qquad \tau(1+c/\beta)<\lambda,\qquad \max\{\lambda,\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)\}<\lambda'<1, \qquad \epsilon C_1<1. \] Fix positive constants $a_d\le b_d$ and $a_r\le b_r$, and fix positive constants $C_M,C_{\rm desc},C_w$ with $C_w>1$. For these fixed choices there are a cutoff $p_0$, one fixed finite-alphabet multitape procedure, and an implicit time constant with the following guarantee. The cutoff and time constant may depend on the fixed rational parameters and these constants. For every choice of positi

If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-fast-butterfly-layers`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
