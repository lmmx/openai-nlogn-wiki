# exegenius task 0006-write-negacyclic-ring

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/Q1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, binomial counting, permutations, induction, graphs, the union bound, and elementary number theory with gcd, primes, modular inverses and the Chinese remainder theorem), an algorithms course (asymptotic notation, recurrences and geometric sums, divide and conquer including Karatsuba, sorting including radix sort, stacks, amortized counters, the RAM model and worst-case running time), and an introductory theory course with Turing machines and multitape tapes. From computer organization they know binary and two's-complement encodings, bit order, XOR and binary arithmetic; from calculus and a first linear-algebra course they know logarithms, exponentials, Newton's method, simple inequalities, complex numbers with conjugates, polynomials, matrices, Gaussian elimination, rank, dot products, projections and eigenvalues over the real or rational numbers. They have not studied abstract algebra (rings, quotient rings, finite fields, tensor products, bilinear forms over 𝔽₂), Fourier analysis, numerical error analysis, or the research literature on fast integer multiplication, so the FFT machinery, resampling and all of the paper's constructions are new to them.

## This page

Concept: Polynomial ring modulo yʳ + 1
Gloss: The ring ℂ[y]/(yʳ + 1) with r a power of two, in which y is a primitive 2r-th root of unity and multiplication by a power of y is a signed cyclic shift of the coefficient list.
Also called: negacyclic ring, R_r
Heading: Polynomial ring modulo $y^r + 1$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $y$ (polynomial variable): The indeterminate of the ring, whose powers act as roots of unity of order 2r.
- $r$ (record length): The number of complex coefficients in a polynomial record, a power of two.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Normalized cyclic convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$ of disk-grid arrays over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ is approximated with error below $\sqrt2M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ at cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$. (on [Ring convolution from the retained layout](synthetic-convolution.md))
- On $d-1$ power-of-two axes of length $2^{\ell}$ or $2^{\ell-1}$ over $\mathcal R_r$, the forward synthetic transform $LBF_{\boldsymbol t}^-$ and its opposite $F_{\boldsymbol t}^+B^{-1}L^{-1}$ are computed with error below $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}$ at cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$. (on [Transform layout and cost](transform-layout.md))
- For disk-grid polynomials $f,g\in\mathcal R_r$, the normalized product $Q_p(fg/r)$ is computed exactly up to its final truncation in $O(rp\log(rp))$ time on fixed tapes. (on [Signed Kronecker packing](signed-packing.md))
- Normalized complex cyclic convolution on the $d$ power-of-two axes satisfies $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=(f*g)/T$, and its computed version is a bilinear approximation built from the ring convolution. (on [Coefficient twist](coefficient-twist.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Signed Kronecker packing: Multiplying two polynomials with signed Gaussian-integer coefficients by evaluating them at B₀ = 2^{4p} into single integers, multiplying with the established multiplier, and extracting centered coefficients before reducing modulo yʳ + 1.
- Synthetic polynomial transform: The Nussbaumer–Quandalle Fourier transform over ℂ[y]/(yʳ + 1) using powers of y as roots of unity, computed by decimation-in-frequency butterflies and monomial twiddles and leaving outputs in bit-reversed order.
- Coefficient twist: The map x ↦ ζy with ζ = e^{πi/r}, which turns cyclic convolution in the last coordinate into negacyclic multiplication modulo yʳ + 1 and back.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two." (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0006-write-negacyclic-ring.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0006-write-negacyclic-ring.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0006-write-negacyclic-ring` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0006-write-negacyclic-ring`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
