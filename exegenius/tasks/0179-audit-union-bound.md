# exegenius task 0179-audit-union-bound

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Union bound

The union bound says that the probability that at least one of several events occurs is at most the sum of their probabilities. The paper uses its counting form to show that the set of exceptional addresses in a packed addition is small, so that the addition is correct at every other address. The [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-bit-addition.md) page builds on that count.

## Statement

Here $\Omega$ is a finite [Ground set](ground-set.md), and the union bound in counting form is applied to subsets of it. Each $E_i$ is one of the subsets of $\Omega$, and $m$ is the number of these subsets, $E_1, \dots, E_m$. The union bound says

$$|E_1 \cup E_2 \cup \cdots \cup E_m| \le |E_1| + |E_2| + \cdots + |E_m|,$$

where $|X|$ is the number of elements of a set $X$. Choose an element of $\Omega$ uniformly at random. The probability that it lies in $E$ is $|E|/|\Omega|$, so dividing by $|\Omega|$ gives the probability form

$$\Pr[E_1 \cup \cdots \cup E_m] \le \Pr[E_1] + \cdots + \Pr[E_m].$$

The bound needs no independence between the events.

**Example.** Let $\Omega = \{0, 1, \dots, 99\}$, $m = 2$, $E_1$ the even numbers in $\Omega$ (50 elements), and $E_2$ the multiples of 5 (20 elements). The union has 60 elements, because the 10 multiples of 10 lie in both sets. The bound gives $60 \le 50 + 20 = 70$. For a uniformly random $x \in \Omega$, the probability that $x$ lies in the union is $0.6$, and the bound gives $0.6 \le 0.5 + 0.2$. The slack of 10 is the overlap, which the bound ignores.

## How the paper uses it

Here $f$ is the number of selected bit positions $j_0, \dots, j_{f-1}$ and $K$ is the width in bits of each segment. Each of the $f-1$ segment pairs carries two guard values, $g$ in $y$ and $h$ in $z$, both in $\{0, \dots, 2^{K-1}-1\}$, so there are $m = 2(f-1)$ guards. The paper notes that coordinates, so a guard value can be treated as uniform on its $2^{K-1}$ values.

A guard is bad when its value falls outside the good range $10 \le g \le 2^{K-1} - 11$, which leaves the 10 smallest and 10 largest values excluded.. So a uniform guard is bad with probability $20/2^{K-1}$.

An address is exceptional when at least one of its guards is bad, so the exceptional set is the union of the per-guard bad sets. Applying the union bound to these $m = 2(f-1)$ events gives a bad fraction of

$$m \cdot \frac{20}{2^{K-1}} = \frac{80(f-1)}{2^{K}}.$$

. The paper caps this at one, since a probability bound above one says nothing:

**Example.** Take $K = 8$, so each guard has $2^{7} = 128$ values, 20 of them bad, and each guard is bad with probability $20/128 = 5/32$. With $f = 3$ there are $m = 4$ guards, and the bound gives $4 \cdot 5/32 = 5/8$. This equals $80 \cdot 2 / 2^{8} = 5/8$, the paper's formula.
