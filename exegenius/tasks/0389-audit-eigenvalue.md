# exegenius task 0389-audit-eigenvalue

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Eigenvalue

An eigenvalue of a linear operator is a scalar for which the operator maps some nonzero vector to a multiple of that same vector. The sources use eigenvalues in one place, to check that a bilinear form is nondegenerate.

Write $V$ for the vector space on which the operator $T$ acts. Write $\theta$ for the eigenvalue, a scalar in $F$. Write $e$ for an eigenvector, a nonzero vector of $V$. An eigenvalue is stated in the language of [Linear algebra basics](linear-algebra-basics.md): a linear operator $T$ on a vector space $V$ over $F$ has eigenvalue $\theta$ when $Te = \theta e$ for some nonzero $e$ in $V$.

Take $h \ge 2$. Let $J$ be the $h\times h$ matrix with every entry equal to $1$, the all-one matrix. Let $\mathbf{1}$ be the vector in $\mathbb{Q}^h$ with every entry equal to $1$. Each entry of $J\mathbf{1}$ is a sum of $h$ ones, so $J\mathbf{1} = h\mathbf{1}$. Let $d$ be any vector in $\mathbb{Q}^h$ whose entries sum to zero. Each entry of $Jd$ is that sum, so $Jd = 0$.

For the operator $T = I - J/9$ this gives $T\mathbf{1} = (1 - h/9)\mathbf{1}$ and $Td = d$. So $\mathbf{1}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $1 - h/9$, and every nonzero $d$ with zero entry sum is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $1$. Taking $h = 100$ gives $1 - 100/9 = -91/9$. Both eigenvalues are nonzero.

A bilinear form on $\mathbb{Q}^h$ is nondegenerate when no nonzero vector is orthogonal to every vector. For a symmetric matrix $A$ this happens exactly when $A$ is invertible. An $h\times h$ matrix is invertible exactly when $0$ is not an eigenvalue, because $0$ is an eigenvalue exactly when the matrix sends some nonzero vector to zero. $\langle x,y\rangle = x^{\mathsf T}(I - J/9)y$, so the matrix is $I - J/9$. The paper checks nondegeneracy from the eigenvalues:
