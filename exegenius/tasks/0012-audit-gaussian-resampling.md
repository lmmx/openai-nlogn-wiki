# exegenius task 0012-audit-gaussian-resampling

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source, which the reader can consult: it is followable by reference, so do not report it as a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Gaussian resampling

Gaussian resampling is a technique that replaces a [Discrete Fourier transform](discrete-fourier-transform.md) of arbitrary length by transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two, which the integer multiplier needs. Gaussian weights are exponential factors that decay quadratically with distance, and they move values between the two sets of frequencies.

Gaussian resampling computes the transforms of a [radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md) from power-of-two transforms.

The integer product needs transform lengths that are pairwise coprime, while the synthetic transforms use powers of two. (cited), so the transform of one length must be moved onto the frequencies of the other.

Here $s$ is the number of coordinates of a source vector. Here $t$ is the number of coordinates of a target vector, with $s<t$ and $\gcd(s,t)=1$. The integer $\alpha$ is the width parameter of the Gaussian weights. $F_s$ and $F_t$ are the normalized Fourier transforms of length $s$ and $t$, and $P_s$ and $P_t$ are the coordinate permutations $(P_su)_j=u_{tj}$ and $(P_tv)_k=v_{-sk}$, with subscripts taken modulo the length.

The operator norm of a linear map is the largest factor by which it stretches a vector in the maximum-modulus norm. A linear map is a contraction when its operator norm is at most 1. $A$ is a linear contraction from vectors of length $s$ to vectors of length $t$, and $B_0$ is a linear contraction from vectors of length $t$ to vectors of length $s$.

The identity rests on two Gaussian-weighted maps $S$ and $T$ from vectors of length $s$ to vectors of length $t$. $D$ is the diagonal map on vectors of length $s$ that multiplies coordinate $j$ by a Gaussian factor, and $C$ selects from a length-$t$ vector the coordinates at the indices nearest $tj/s$, for $0\le j<s$. Put $N=CTD$, a map close to the identity.

1. $TP_sF_s=P_tF_tS$, the Gaussian resampling identity before normalization.
2. $\|N-I\|<1/2$, so $N$ is invertible. If $\|N-I\|<1$, then $N^{-1}=\sum_{k\ge 0}(I-N)^k$, a Neumann series whose terms shrink geometrically in operator norm.
3. Since $CT=ND^{-1}$, the map $DN^{-1}C$ is a left inverse of $T$, because $(DN^{-1}C)T=DN^{-1}ND^{-1}=I$. Applying it to step 1 gives $DN^{-1}CP_tF_tS=P_sF_s$.
4. The factors of 2 are absorbed by taking $A=S/2$ and $B_0=2^{-(2\alpha^2-2)}DN^{-1}C/2$. Their scale factors multiply to $2^{-2\alpha^2}$, so $B_0P_tF_tA=2^{-2\alpha^2}P_sF_s$.

Multiplying by $2^{2\alpha^2}$ gives $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$, with contractions $A$ and $B_0$.
