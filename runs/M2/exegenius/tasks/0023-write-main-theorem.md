# exegenius task 0023-write-main-theorem

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/M2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)) on a multitape Turing machine
Gloss: A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two n-bit integers exactly in O(n(lg n)^{1-κ}) time with κ=2^{-182}, disproving the n log n optimality conjecture in this model.
Heading: Integer multiplication in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $n$ (operand length): The number of bits of each input integer.
- $\kappa$ (power saving): The fixed constant 2^{-182} giving the power saving in the logarithmic factor.

## This page in the argument

The step: A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.
How: speed up the tape operations of the transform-based multiplication by a power of the logarithm, then assemble the multiplication
Why: The O(n log n) bound is limited by scanning n bits at each of log n transform levels, so a power saving needs cheaper address rearrangement and butterfly layers, which must then be placed inside the exact multiplication. (the sources say so: "We therefore need savings in both movement and arithmetic. Two tape" (paper))
Striking feature: The saving is a genuine power of the logarithm, yet the exponent kappa=2^{-182} is astronomically small because the nested parameter choices are deliberately conservative. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Two tape procedures cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ for interchanging address fields of $u$ bits and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a butterfly layer on $d$ chunks, with $\tau,\lambda'<1$, on bit volume $V$.
- Exact multiplication of $n$-bit integers reduces, by a chain of changes of representation with parameters chosen consistently, to ring convolution, and the total cost is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$. (on [Assembly of the multiplication algorithm](multiplication-assembly.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1**: Two tape procedures cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ for interchanging address fields of $u$ bits and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a butterfly layer on $d$ chunks, with $\tau,\lambda'<1$, on bit volume $V$.
How: build fixed linear exchange networks with frames and subspaces, then recurse so that the number of smaller calls gives a power saving

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S2 (on [Assembly of the multiplication algorithm](multiplication-assembly.md)): Exact multiplication of $n$-bit integers reduces, by a chain of changes of representation with parameters chosen consistently, to ring convolution, and the total cost is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.
- S1.1 (on [Linear exchange networks with frames and roles](linear-network-frames.md)): A fixed linear network exchanging two banks of values and restoring auxiliary values acts pointwise on arrays via invertible frame operators that cancel along routes.
- S1.2 (on [Three-subset networks with rank saving](subset-network.md)): Networks from three-element subsets with nested subspaces at gates and terminals have total number $s$ of smaller calls less than $Wm$.
- S1.3 (on [Recursive power saving](recursive-saving.md)): Recursion with $s$ calls at parameter $f$ on volume $V/W$, with $s/W<m$, yields a power saving over naive passes.
- S1.4 (on [Address interchange in time O(V u^τ)](address-interchange.md)): Interchanging two disjoint address fields of $u$ bits on volume $V$ takes time $O(Vu^\tau)$ with exact final permutation.
- S1.5 (on [Simultaneous butterfly layer in time O(V d^λ′)](simultaneous-butterfly.md)): Applying $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ on the same bit in up to $d$ address chunks takes time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ using exact Gaussian dyadics and one final truncation.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Assembly of the multiplication algorithm](multiplication-assembly.md): Chains digit convolution, CRT, Gaussian resampling, chirps, twist to the polynomial ring, rescaling, rounding and carry propagation, with parameters chosen so the cost table fits the theorem.

- [The n log n optimality conjecture and prior bounds](nlogn-conjecture.md): Schönhage and Strassen's O(n log n log log n) multiplier and conjecture that n log n is optimal, followed by the Harvey–van der Hoeven O(n log n) multiplier.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-main-theorem.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-main-theorem.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0023-write-main-theorem` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-main-theorem`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
