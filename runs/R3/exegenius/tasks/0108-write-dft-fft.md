# exegenius task 0108-write-dft-fft

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Discrete Fourier transform and butterflies
Gloss: Evaluation of a coefficient list at roots of unity, computed in log-many levels of two-point butterfly operations; turns convolution into pointwise product.
Also called: transform (the DFT/FFT the layout is for), twiddle factor, bit-reversed input, forward transform of length S

## Where the argument relies on this page

- A simultaneous layer of $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ on selected address bits of polynomial-valued arrays costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$, with a single truncation at the end. (on [Fast simultaneous butterfly layers](fast-butterfly-layers.md))
- Gaussian resampling expresses each source Fourier transform through a power-of-two tensor transform. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform into normalized cyclic convolution. (on [Bluestein's chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md))
- Convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ on the remaining axes is computed by synthetic transforms and packed polynomial products. (on [Convolution with retained transform order and cancelled permutations](ring-convolution-retained-order.md))
- Synthetic transforms over the polynomial ring need only signed shifts, address rearrangements and butterflies. (on [Synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md))

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "two-point butterfly operations" (paper)

  > In this representation, the transform calculation consists of address rearrangements, signed shifts, and two-point butterfly operations. Scanning an array of $\Theta(n)$ stored bits at each of $\Theta(\log n)$ transform levels already costs $\Theta(n\log n)$. We therefore need savings in both movement and arithmetic. Two tape procedures supply them; in both bounds, $V$ denotes the stored bit volume.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "The source builds its tape-level transform the same way, from (cited)." (The page does not say how butterflies and the address rearrangements and shifts are composed into a multitape procedure. The cited source is given as the only account of the tape-level construction, so the claim that it is built the same way stands in for how the transform works on tapes and cannot be checked from the page.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- Cite or cut this step: "the pair at offsets $t$ and $t+h/2$ uses $s=tn/h$." (The page never states that the sub-transforms at block size h use the root omega^{n/h}. Without that, the reader cannot see why the butterfly exponent is tn/h rather than the top-level m, so the per-level exponent is asserted rather than derived.). It is inside reasoning added for an earlier step, so do not explain it further: cite the source for it, or remove the claim.
- Say what $m$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "where $m$, $0\le m<n$, is the frequency index."

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 237 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 296 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) evaluates a coefficient list at powers of a root of unity, reducing [Convolution](convolution.md) to a pointwise product.

Let $a=(a_0,\dots,a_{n-1})$ have $n$ entries, a power of two. Let $\omega$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity: $\omega^n=1$, and $\omega^m\ne1$ for each frequency index $m$ with $0<m<n$. The transform of $a$ is the list $A=(A_0,\dots,A_{n-1})$ with

$$A_m=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i\,\omega^{im},$$

where $m$, $0\le m<n$, is the frequency index.

A butterfly is the two-point operation $(u,v)\mapsto(u+\omega^s v,\;u-\omega^s v)$; $u$, $v$ are its inputs and $s$ the exponent of its power.

Split the sum by the parity of $i$. Let $E$ and $O$ be the transforms with root $\omega^2$ of the even- and odd-indexed entries of $a$. Since $\omega^{n/2}=-1$, $A_m=E_m+\omega^mO_m$ and $A_{m+n/2}=E_m-\omega^mO_m$ for $0\le m<n/2$, a butterfly with $s=m$. Recursing gives $\log_2 n$ levels. Here $h$ is the number of entries in a block and $t$ an offset in the block. Each level combines two transforms of length $h/2$ into one of length $h$: the pair at offsets $t$ and $t+h/2$ uses $s=tn/h$. With bit-reversed input, the last level leaves $A_0,\dots,A_{n-1}$ in order.

On tapes, the transform is built from butterflies and the rearrangements and shifts of [Address fields and array layout on tapes](address-fields.md). The source builds its tape-level transform the same way, from <cite data-source="paper">two-point butterfly operations</cite>.

Let $B$ and $C$ be the transforms of $b$ and of $c_k=\sum_i a_i\,b_{(k-i)\bmod n}$. With $l=(k-i)\bmod n$, the index into $b$ paired with $i$ at output $k$: as $\omega^n=1$, $\omega^{km}=\omega^{(i+l)m}$, and $l$ ranges over all indices, so $C_m=\sum_i a_i\omega^{im}\sum_l b_l\omega^{lm}=A_mB_m$. The inverse $c_k=\frac1n\sum_m C_m\omega^{-km}$ recovers $c$, since $\sum_m\omega^{dm}$ is $n$ if $d\equiv0$ and $0$ otherwise, for an integer $d$. So transforming, multiplying entrywise and transforming back gives $c$.
