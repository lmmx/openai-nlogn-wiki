# exegenius task 0454-audit-transform-layout

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Transform layout

A transform layout is a permutation of record addresses that gathers the selected bits of all participating axes at one common offset. The transform layout prepares the input for each [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md) of a transform round. Its cost is charged in the bound for [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md).

Each entry of a multidimensional array sits at a binary address; its bits are the *address bits*. Each coordinate of the array is an *axis*, and each address holds one *record*, a polynomial with $r$ complex coefficients. A *chunk* is a run of consecutive address bits. A *selected bit* is an address bit on which a round's butterfly acts: the [butterfly](butterfly.md) $H_0(\xi,\eta)=((\xi+\eta)/2,(\xi-\eta)/2)$ pairs two entries that differ in that bit. A *transform round* applies one such butterfly on each participating axis.

A round needs its selected bits in $D$ consecutive $K$-bit chunks, each selecting the bit at one common offset $\rho$, counted from the least significant end, with $0 \le \rho < K$. One pass applies $H_0$ to the selected bit of every chunk, which needs those bits at one offset. Without this shape, a round would need one pass per axis.

The transform layout is an explicit [permutation](permutation.md) $\mathcal{L}$ of record addresses. A record's coefficients form a contiguous block of trailing address bits, its [polynomial suffix](polynomial-ring.md). The transform layout keeps each element of the [polynomial ring](polynomial-ring.md) that a record holds intact.

Address bits are read in *physical order*, leading end first. A long axis has $\lg r$ address bits and a short axis has $\lg r-1$, where $\lg r$ is the base-two logarithm of $r$. The first phase builds a *prefix*, the leading part of the physical order: the top bit of each long axis, then the bits at positions below $(\lg r-1)\bmod K$, counted from the least significant end, from the highest down, axes in order within each position. Here $(\lg r-1)\bmod K$ is the remainder of $\lg r-1$ on division by $K$: the bits left over after full $K$-bit chunks.

Each axis's bits outside the prefix, positions $(\lg r-1)\bmod K$ up to $\lg r-2$, form $\lfloor(\lg r-1)/K\rfloor$ consecutive $K$-bit chunks, on long and short axes alike. Number them from the highest down; this number is the *chunk index*. Chunk exchanges then put the $D$ chunks with one index next to each other.

A round at a position $\delta$, counted from the least significant end, selects that bit on each axis, at offset $\rho = (\delta-((\lg r-1)\bmod K))\bmod K$ within its chunk. The offset is the same on every axis, because each axis's chunks tile its outside bits upward from position $(\lg r-1)\bmod K$ in blocks of $K$. So each group of $D$ chunks with one index shares one offset.

The layout is built from [address-field interchange](address-interchange.md) moves of whole chunks, together with single-bit moves. Each such move is counted in the cost.

The forward procedure may keep its output order. Products are taken address by address, so permuting both operands permutes the product alike. The transform layout feeds its retained order to the [opposite transform](opposite-transform.md). The layout is applied within each round of the [synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md).
