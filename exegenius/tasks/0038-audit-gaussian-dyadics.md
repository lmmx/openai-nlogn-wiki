# exegenius task 0038-audit-gaussian-dyadics

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Gaussian dyadics

A Gaussian dyadic is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are integers divided by a common power of two. The simultaneous butterfly layer depends on this set: its intermediate values stay in it, so the layer is computed exactly and rounding happens only once, at the end.

Let $\mathbb{D}$ denote the set of Gaussian dyadics. Each element of $\mathbb{D}$ has the form $a/2^k$, in which $a$ is a Gaussian integer, an element of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, and $k$ is a non-negative integer, the power of two in the denominator. Since $a$ has integer real and imaginary parts, the real and imaginary parts of $a/2^k$ are integers divided by $2^k$.

The number $\frac{1+i}{2}$ is a Gaussian dyadic with $a = 1+i$ and $k = 1$. The number $\frac{1}{3}$ is not one, because $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{a}{2^k}$ would require $3a = 2^k$, which has no solution with $a$ a Gaussian integer.

The set is closed under addition and multiplication. For a product, $\frac{a}{2^k}\cdot\frac{b}{2^l} = \frac{ab}{2^{k+l}}$ with $ab \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$. For a sum, write both terms over $2^{\max(k,l)}$. For instance, $\frac{1+i}{2}\cdot\frac{1-i}{2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.

The paper's kernels stay in this set. The kernel and its inverse have entries that are Gaussian integers divided by $2^m$,

For the layer itself, and the phase factors and scalar corrections stay in the same set: Because every step is exact,
