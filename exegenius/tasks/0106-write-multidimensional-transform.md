# exegenius task 0106-write-multidimensional-transform

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Multidimensional transform
Gloss: A Fourier transform over several axes at once, computed by transforming along each axis in turn.
Also called: multidimensional transforms with power-of-two axes

## Where the argument relies on this page

- The Fourier transforms in the convolution are replaced by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- The source and target coordinate permutations stay inside the transform identity and are not executed as sorts. (on [Transform identity with retained permutations](transform-identity.md))

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:
