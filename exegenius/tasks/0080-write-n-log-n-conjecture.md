# exegenius task 0080-write-n-log-n-conjecture

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Gloss: The conjecture that n log n is the optimal order of growth of the time needed to multiply two n-bit integers.
Also called: Schönhage–Strassen conjecture

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Exact multiplication of two $n$-bit integers runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time on one deterministic fixed-tape machine, with $\kappa = 2^{-182}$. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))

## Symbols already bound on earlier pages

The symbols in the names of the concepts the reader knows are listed with those concepts above.

- $D_v$ (frame), bound on [Linear networks and frames](linear-network-frames.md): The invertible linear operator on arrays attached to vertex $v$ of a network, so that the stored array at $v$ is $D_v g$.
- $g$ (logical array), bound on [Linear networks and frames](linear-network-frames.md): The array a wire is meant to represent before any frame is applied.
- $G$ (pointwise gate), bound on [Linear networks and frames](linear-network-frames.md): A fixed linear map that combines the entries of several wires at each address.
- $n$ (input length), bound on [Fixed-tape machine model](fixed-tape-model.md): The number of bits in each of the two input integers.
- $A$ (fixed machine), bound on [Fixed-tape machine model](fixed-tape-model.md): A fixed multiplication machine, whose alphabet and tape count do not depend on the input.
- $T_A$ (running time), bound on [Fixed-tape machine model](fixed-tape-model.md): The worst-case running time of machine A as a function of the input length n.

- $n$ (input length), bound on [Exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md): The number of bits in each input string.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md): Given binary strings x and y of length n, output the 2n-bit binary representation of their product.
  Shown as: The n log n optimality conjecture *<predicate>* Exact integer multiplication
- [Limit inferior](limit-inferior.md): The smallest value that a sequence approaches infinitely often; its limit inferior is zero when it has subsequences that tend to zero.

## Evidence from the sources

- "proposed n log n as the optimal order of growth" (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "The negation of the conjecture is that some one machine $A$ satisfies" (The reader cannot check that this is the negation of the quantified statement, since that depends on the unexplained liminf and on the quantifier structure, which the page does not spell out.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Schönhage and Strassen proved in 1971 that two $n$-bit integers can be multiplied in time on a multitape Turing machine, and they." (The sentence leaves the time bound blank and never states what was proved, so the claimed upper bound cannot be checked.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Harvey and van der Hoeven later established an, so $n \log n$ is achievable" (The object of 'established' is missing, so the reader cannot tell what was established and the conclusion that n log n is achievable does not follow from the text.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The paper confirms that this" (The page ends mid-sentence, and the unnamed paper is never identified, so the reader cannot check what it is said to confirm.)
- Say what $\log$ denotes where it is first used (for a size or count, what it counts): "It claims that $n \log n$ is the optimal order of growth of that time." (Nothing on the page says what \log denotes or which base it uses. The later definition of \lg does not bind \log.)
- Say what $\liminf$ denotes where it is first used (for a size or count, what it counts): "$\liminf_{n\to\infty} T_A(n)/(n\lg n) = 0$" (The limit inferior is never defined, explained or linked, so the reader cannot tell what the negation says.)
- "limit inferior" is the concept [Limit inferior](limit-inferior.md), now a prerequisite: link it where the term is used.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 378 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 472 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

The n log n optimality conjecture concerns the time to multiply two integers, where $n$ is the number of bits in each input. It claims that $n \log n$ is the optimal order of growth of that time. The main theorem of this wiki, [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md), refutes it, so this page states exactly what is refuted.

The conjecture bounds the cost of [exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md) from below. Schönhage and Strassen proved in 1971 that two $n$-bit integers can be multiplied in <cite data-source="paper">O(n log n log log n)</cite> time on a multitape Turing machine, and they <cite data-source="paper">proposed n log n as the optimal order of growth</cite>. Harvey and van der Hoeven later established an <cite data-source="paper">unconditional O(n log n) bound</cite>, so $n \log n$ is achievable, and the conjecture says that nothing of smaller order is.

A lower bound only makes sense for a fixed machine, so the conjecture is stated for a fixed model. The paper's setting is <cite data-source="paper">one fixed finite-alphabet Turing machine with a fixed finite number</cite> of one-dimensional tapes, where the alphabet and the number of tapes do not grow with the input length.

Let $A$ be one fixed Turing machine that computes exact products. Let $T_A(n)$ be the worst-case running time of $A$ on inputs of two $n$-bit integers, the largest number of steps $A$ takes over all such inputs. Write $\lg n = \max\{\lceil \log_2 n\rceil, 1\}$ for the base-2 logarithm of $n$, rounded up to an integer and never below $1$.

The conjecture says that for every such machine $A$ there are constants $c_A > 0$ and $N_A$ such that the following holds.

$$T_A(n) \ge c_A\, n \lg n \quad \text{for all } n \ge N_A.$$

The paper states this as <cite data-source="paper">an eventual lower bound for every multiplication machine means</cite> the inequality above, for each fixed machine.

The negation of the conjecture is that some one machine $A$ satisfies $\liminf_{n\to\infty} T_A(n)/(n\lg n) = 0$. The growth gap is large. Take $n = 1024$ and $n = 2048$: then $\lg n = 10$ and $\lg n = 11$, so $n \lg n$ grows from $10240$ to $22528$, a factor of $2.2$ when $n$ doubles. Schoolbook multiplication, which takes on the order of $n^2$ steps, grows by a factor of $4$.

The main theorem gives one fixed machine with $T_A(n) = O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for a specific constant $\kappa > 0$. Since $(\lg n)^{-\kappa} \to 0$, this machine has $T_A(n)/(n\lg n) \to 0$, which is the negation above. The paper confirms that this <cite data-source="paper">optimality conjecture of Schönhage and Strassen in this model.</cite>
