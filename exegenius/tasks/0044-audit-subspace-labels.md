# exegenius task 0044-audit-subspace-labels

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file and the paper at `sources/paper.tex`: do not read other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Fidelity: also check that the page's mathematics is right, and report what is wrong even where this reader could follow it. For each claim that states a definition, a hypothesis, a step of a proof, a value or a conclusion, work out what it assumes and what it concludes, and check it against everything this task file gives: the page's definitions, its other claims and its quotations. Report as a `step` any claim that is false, inconsistent with another statement on the page, stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it, or missing a hypothesis it needs. Quote the claim, and say in the note what is wrong and what the correct statement is.

The source: the paper this page explains is at `sources/paper.tex` (LaTeX). For each such claim, also find the passage of the paper that states, defines or proves it (search the file for the claim's terms and symbols, then read the passage around each match) and compare: every hypothesis present, the same scope and quantifiers, the same constants, signs, exponents and inequality directions, a conclusion no stronger than the paper's, and the right result, lemma or author credited. Report any mismatch as a `step` in the same way, and give the paper's line number in the note.

What counts as an error: report a claim as wrong only if, as this page states it, it is false; inconsistent with the page; stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it; missing a hypothesis without which it is false; given a wrong value, sign, exponent, constant, quantifier or credit; or presented as following from something it does not follow from. Do not report a correct statement as wrong because it is informal, abbreviated or simplified, uses a word in the paper's own sense, or leaves a technical precondition to another page or to the paper. If the paper's own summary of the same step states it the same way, it is not an error.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is a computer science undergraduate: they have taken discrete mathematics, an algorithms course (asymptotics, divide and conquer, schoolbook and Karatsuba multiplication, sorting), a first linear algebra course (vector spaces, subspaces, dimension, rank, matrices as linear maps, inverses, triangular matrices, orthogonality, bilinear forms at a basic level), calculus, elementary number theory (primes, gcd, modular arithmetic) and basic machine-level binary representation (XOR, two's complement). They have seen Turing machines with tapes only at an introductory level.

# Nested subspace labels and rank deficit

Nested subspace labels give each vertex of the [exchange network](exchange-network.md) a subspace of an $m$-dimensional space, nested along edges, whose dimension changes count the edge's smaller calls. They choose the frames of [Frames on wire arrays](array-frames.md) so that a network of $W$ wires makes $s<Wm$ smaller calls.

*Triples* (three-element subsets of a ground set of size $h=100$) index the network; bit labels live in $F=\mathbb Q^h$ with the nondegenerate form $\langle x,y\rangle=x^{\mathsf T}y-\frac19(\sum_ix_i)(\sum_iy_i)$ (cited), complex ones in $F=\mathbb F_2^h$ with the dot product. Indicator vectors $t_S,t_T$ of triples $S,T$ satisfy $t_S^{\mathsf T}t_T=|S\cap T|$ and sum to $3$, so $\langle t_S,t_T\rangle=|S\cap T|-1$; over $\mathbb F_2$, $t_S\cdot t_T=|S\cap T|\bmod 2$. Thus each line $\langle t_T\rangle$ is *nondegenerate* ($\langle t_T,t_T\rangle\neq0$, so $F=\langle t_T\rangle\perp t_T^\perp$), and neighbours (sharing one element, or an even number) are orthogonal.

The space $\mathcal F=F^{\otimes3}$ of $h\times h\times h$ arrays has dimension $m=h^3$; $x\otimes y\otimes z$ has entries $x_iy_kz_l$, forms multiply factorwise and $\dim(U\otimes V)=\dim U\dim V$. $N$ counts the tuples $a=(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ of triples indexing the data wires $X_a,Y_a$. With $U_a=\langle t_{a_1}\otimes t_{a_2}\otimes t_{a_3}\rangle$ the terminal labels are

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}&\text{source}&\text{sink}\\\hline X_a&U_a&\mathcal F\\ Y_a&0&U_a^\perp\\ \text{scratch}&0&\mathcal F\end{array}
$$

Source dimensions total $N$ and sink dimensions $Nm+N(m-1)+(W-2N)m=Wm-N$. Gate wires share the gate's label, so signed changes telescope along wires to $Wm-2N$. If decreasing edges lose $L$ dimensions in all, absolute changes total $Wm-2N+2L$; saving needs small $L$.

Stage $j$ varies $a_j$; put $A=F^{\otimes(j-1)},\ P=\langle t_{a_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes t_{a_{j-1}}\rangle,\ B=P^\perp\cap A,\ K=\langle t_{a_{j+1}}\otimes\cdots\otimes t_{a_3}\rangle$ (empty products are scalars). Data labels move

$$
X:\ A\otimes\langle t_{a_j}\rangle\otimes K\to A\otimes F\otimes K,\qquad Y:\ B\otimes\langle t_{a_j}\rangle\otimes K\to(P\otimes\langle t_{a_j}\rangle)^\perp_{A\otimes F}\otimes K.
$$

With $A'=A\otimes F,\ B'=(P\otimes\langle t_{a_j}\rangle)^\perp_{A'},\ K=\langle t_{a_{j+1}}\rangle\otimes K'$ the outputs $A'\otimes\langle t_{a_{j+1}}\rangle\otimes K',\ B'\otimes\langle t_{a_{j+1}}\rangle\otimes K'$ are stage $j+1$'s inputs; stage $1$ starts at $U_a,0$ ($B=0$) and stage $3$ ends at $\mathcal F,U_a^\perp$.

In a stage (times bracketed, gate labels tensored by $K$, $t_X,t_Y$ the $X$ and $Y$ triples a side wire joins):

$$
\begin{aligned}\text{centre: }&0\to B\otimes F\,(1)\to A\otimes F\,(3)\to B\otimes F\,(4)\to A\otimes F\,(6)\to\mathcal F\\ \text{side: }&0\to B\otimes\langle t_Y\rangle\,(0)\to(B\otimes F)\perp(P\otimes\langle t_X\rangle)\,(2)\to(B\otimes F)\perp(P\otimes t_Y^\perp)\,(5)\to A\otimes F\,(7)\to\mathcal F\\ X:\ &A\otimes\langle t_X\rangle\to(B\otimes F)\perp(P\otimes\langle t_X\rangle)\,(2)\to A\otimes F\,(3,6,7)\\ Y:\ &B\otimes\langle t_Y\rangle\,(0)\to B\otimes F\,(1,4)\to(B\otimes F)\perp(P\otimes t_Y^\perp)\,(5)\end{aligned}
$$

Splitting $A=B\perp P$ and $F=\langle t_T\rangle\perp t_T^\perp$ shows every arrow is an inclusion except centre $3\to4$, dropping $P\otimes F$ of dimension $h$; side $2\to5$ needs $t_X\perp t_Y$. With $I$ invocations of $\gamma$ central wires each, $L=I\gamma h$. As $I=3\binom h3^2$ and $N=\binom h3^3$, $L/N=3\gamma h/\binom h3$, below $1/2$: $L_{\rm b}/N=100/539$ and $L_{\rm c}/N=101/539$ for $\gamma=100,101$ (cited).

Bit vertices labelled $U$ get the rational projection $\Pi_U$ onto $U$ along $U^\perp$, except $X_a$'s source ($-\Pi_{U_a}$). For $U\subset V$, $\Pi_V-\Pi_U$ (identity on $V\cap U^\perp$, zero on $U\perp V^\perp$) has rank $\dim V-\dim U$, as does its negative. Only $X_a$'s first edge, into a gate labelled $U_a$, differs: $2\Pi_{U_a}$ has rank one, its dimension change zero. An edge costs one smaller call per unit of rank (cited), so $s_{\rm b}=(W_{\rm b}m-2N+2L_{\rm b})+N=W_{\rm b}m-(N-2L_{\rm b})<W_{\rm b}m$ (cited). Endpoint differences, $\Pi_{U_a^\perp}+\Pi_{U_a}$ from $X_a$ and $\mathrm{Id}-0$ otherwise, all equal $\mathrm{Id}$: one frame change on every route. [Binary phase frames](phase-frames.md) give the complex network $s_{\rm c}=W_{\rm c}m-2N+2L_{\rm c}<W_{\rm c}m$.

The relative saving $(W_{\rm b}m-s_{\rm b})/(W_{\rm b}m)=339/22587335000000\approx1.5\cdot10^{-11}$ (cited) is positive as $L_{\rm b}/N<1/2$ but tiny, at most $N$ of $W_{\rm b}m\approx4\cdot10^{10}N$.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0044-audit-subspace-labels.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0044-audit-subspace-labels` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0044-audit-subspace-labels`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
