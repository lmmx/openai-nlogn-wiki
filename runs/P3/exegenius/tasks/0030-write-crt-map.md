# exegenius task 0030-write-crt-map

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Chinese-remainder map to distinct prime axes
Gloss: With pairwise coprime axis lengths s_i and product S, the map x ↦ ∏ x_i^{μ_i} is an isomorphism from C[x]/(x^S−1) to the multi-axis cyclic ring, converting one long cyclic convolution into a multidimensional one; on tape it is a sequence of triangular controlled shifts.

## This page in the argument

The step: With pairwise coprime axis lengths $s_i$, the map $x\mapsto\prod_i x_i^{\mu_i}$ is an isomorphism from $\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)$ onto the multi-axis cyclic ring, converting one long cyclic convolution into a multidimensional one, and acts on tape by triangular controlled shifts.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time, with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers), use them for a fast synthetic-transform convolution over a polynomial ring, wrap that in the Gaussian-resampling, Bluestein and CRT reduction of integer multiplication, then recover the exact product and total the cost (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Forming radix-$2^b$ digits, applying the CRT map $\Phi$, computing two forward source transforms, multiplying pointwise, applying the opposite transform, rescaling by $S$ and $2^{2b+4}S$, rounding, inverting $\Phi$ and propagating carries outputs the exact $2n$-bit product.; how: reduce the integer product to a cyclic convolution of radix-digit lists on a product of distinct prime axes, compute that convolution with three source transforms, and recover the exact coefficients by rounding (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Multidimensional transforms (tensor products)](multidim-transform.md): A transform on an array indexed by several axes is the tensor product of one-dimensional transforms, computed one axis at a time; convolution on the product group corresponds to pointwise product.
  Shown as: Chinese-remainder map to distinct prime axes *<predicate>* Multidimensional transforms (tensor products)
- [Cyclic convolution and the convolution theorem](convolution.md): Cyclic convolution u*v multiplies polynomials modulo x^q − 1 and equals, up to normalization, the inverse transform of the pointwise product of the transforms.
  Shown as: Chinese-remainder map to distinct prime axes *<predicate>* Cyclic convolution and the convolution theorem
- [Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings](controlled-shift.md): Updating a later address field y by y+a(controls) mod q^b, or multiplying it by a fixed rational unit, costs O(V) on tape by splitting each fibre in two pieces and merging them in swapped order.
  Shown as: Chinese-remainder map to distinct prime axes *<predicate>* Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings

## Pages that build on this one

- The multiplication algorithm: Form radix-2^b digits, apply the CRT map Φ, compute two forward source transforms, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, rescale by S and 2^{2b+4}S, round, invert Φ, and propagate carries to output the 2n-bit product.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "First, the radix-digit coefficient list is placed on a product of" (paper)

  > The remaining proof places these procedures inside the multiplication reduction and accounts for every change of representation. First, the radix-digit coefficient list is placed on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map that preserves convolution. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} implements this map through triangular controlled shifts and charged axis moves. Gaussian resampling then expresses each source Fourier transform through a power-of-two tensor transform. Section~\ref{sec:resampling} retains the source and target coordinate permutations in the transform identity, so they need not be executed as separate full sorts.

- "respects $x^S=1$, so it defines an algebra map." (paper)

  > Let $s_1,\ldots,s_d$ be the pairwise coprime source lengths, let $S=\prod_i s_i$, and put \[ P_i=\prod_{j<i}s_j,\qquad \mu_i=P_i^{-1}\pmod{s_i}. \] Here $P_i$ denotes an integer prefix product, not a Fourier-coordinate permutation. The assignment \[ \Phi:\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\longrightarrow \mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_d]/(x_1^{s_1}-1,\ldots,x_d^{s_d}-1), \qquad x\longmapsto\prod_i x_i^{\mu_i} \] respects $x^S=1$, so it defines an algebra map. The target monomial group has size $S$, and the image of $x$ has order $S$, because each $\mu_i$ is a unit and the $s_i$ are pairwise coprime. Its powers therefore run through all target basis monomials exactly once. Hence $\Phi$ is an isomorphism and preserves cyclic convolution.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0030-write-crt-map.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0030-write-crt-map.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0030-write-crt-map` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0030-write-crt-map`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
