# exegenius task 0035-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Simultaneous butterfly layer
Gloss: The second tape procedure: applying H₀ at the same bit position in d address chunks of every record in O(V d^λ') time, evaluated exactly with guard bits and truncated once.

## This page in the argument

The step: A simultaneous layer applying $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ at bit position $\rho$ of each of $D\le d$ consecutive $K$-bit address chunks of every record runs in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with $\lambda'<1$, evaluating exactly and truncating once with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$.
How: Write $H_0^{\otimes D}$ as phases around a layer of the kernel $C$, evaluate $C^{\otimes e}$ by the complex network recursion on $s$ slots of $e/m$ chunks with binary basis changes done by packed XORs, split rows among roles, solve the recurrence, and bound the guard bits needed for exactness.
Why: Applying the butterflies one axis at a time would need $D$ whole-array passes, so the layer is done in one recursion whose cost per level obeys the same rank saving $s<Wm$. (the sources say so: "$\lambda'<1$ and $V$ the logical bit volume, whereas separate butterfly" (paper))
Striking feature: One layer of up to $d$ butterflies costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$, less than the $d$ separate passes of cost $\Theta(V)$ each, and the whole layer is evaluated exactly and truncated only once. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- With $C=aI+bX$, $a=(1+i)/2$, $b=(1-i)/2$ and $\mathsf S=\operatorname{diag}(1,i)$, the two-point butterfly satisfies $H_0=b\,\mathsf SC\mathsf S$, and $C^2=X$, $C^4=I$. (on [Butterfly kernel H₀ and phase kernel C](butterfly-and-phase-kernels.md))
- The complex network with column frames evaluates $C^{\otimes e}$ on $e=mf$ chunks with exactly $s_{\rm c}$ child calls on $f$ chunks each, plus a fixed number of binary row additions as basis changes.
- On all selected coordinates $H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\,\mathcal S_D\,C^{\otimes D}\,\mathcal S_D$, where $\mathcal S_D$ multiplies by $i^{x_1+\cdots+x_D}$, so a normalized layer is exact Gaussian dyadic phases around a $C$ layer.
- XORing the selected bits $x_{j_i}$ into $y_{j_i}$ at the $f$ positions $j_i=\rho+iK$ across whole chunks, restoring a third chunk, costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ by eight cyclic shifts and a deterministic repair of an exceptional address set of density at most $80(f-1)2^{-K}$. (on [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md))
- Splitting padded rows cyclically among the $W$ roles gives each child call a stream of volume $V/W$ on a fixed number of tapes, with the scratch roles supplied by existing rows.
- The normalized cost satisfies $F(e)\le(s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)$ and unrolls, with $a=s/W<m^\lambda$, to $O(d^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$.
- A bound $\Delta=\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil$ on the arithmetic depth of the layer controls both denominator and magnitude growth, so $p+\Delta$ fractional and $\Delta+3$ integer bits represent every intermediate value exactly, and $\Delta=o(p)$. (on [Exact Gaussian dyadic arithmetic and guard bits](guard-bits-dyadic.md))
- Since every row of $\mathcal H$ has absolute row sum one, $\mathcal H$ maps disk arrays to disk arrays, and the single final truncation $Q_p$ changes the result by less than $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$ in the maximum norm.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time, with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Split the integers into radix digits, compute the digit convolution with synthetic transforms whose data movement and butterfly arithmetic are accelerated by two new tape procedures, and recover the exact product by rounding and carries. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](integer-multiplication-below-nlogn.md))
- Two tape procedures exist: interchanging two $u$-bit address chunks of an array of volume $V$ in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time with $\tau<1$, and applying $H_0$ at one bit position in each of $D\le d$ address chunks in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with $\lambda'<1$.; how: Build one fixed linear network per procedure that exchanges two banks of values with signs while restoring all scratch wires, label it with nested subspaces so that the sum $s$ of edge ranks is below $Wm$, and recurse on the edges.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S4.2, S4.3, S4.5, S4.6, S4.8). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S4.2**: The complex network with column frames evaluates $C^{\otimes e}$ on $e=mf$ chunks with exactly $s_{\rm c}$ child calls on $f$ chunks each, plus a fixed number of binary row additions as basis changes.
Source: "Summing its residual dimensions gives exactly" (paper)
> \paragraph{The exact recursive contract.} Apply the finite network with these column frames to a group of $e=mf$ selected axes. Summing its residual dimensions gives exactly $s_{\rm c}$ child calls, each on the $f=e/m$ axes of one slot. The source and sink $Z_{a,f}$ signs, together with the scalar $i^{27f}$ at each affected sink, turn every endpoint kernel into a forward one. Negating the prescribed physical bank and undoing its exchange returns each result to its original role. Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface} therefore gives $C^{\otimes e}$ on every role, including roles whose initial scratch values were arbitrary. Formula~\eqref{eq:phase-inverse-child} supplies each inverse child from one forward call, and none of the corrections adds a child. The remaining operations are a fixed number of binary row additions and coefficientwise scalar operations.

**S4.3**: On all selected coordinates $H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\,\mathcal S_D\,C^{\otimes D}\,\mathcal S_D$, where $\mathcal S_D$ multiplies by $i^{x_1+\cdots+x_D}$, so a normalized layer is exact Gaussian dyadic phases around a $C$ layer.
Source: "\eqref{eq:phase-basic-identities} on all selected coordinates gives" (paper)
> \paragraph{Returning to normalized butterflies.} For an address $x$ in a full layer, write $x_1,\ldots,x_D$ for its selected bits. The diagonal operator $\mathcal S_D$ multiplies the value stored at an address by the phase determined by those bits: \[ (\mathcal S_D z)(x)=i^{x_1+\cdots+x_D}z(x). \] Here the unselected address bits are unchanged, and the same phase is applied to every coefficient stored at that address. Applying \eqref{eq:phase-basic-identities} on all selected coordinates gives \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-butterfly-layer} H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_D C^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D. \end{equation} The scalar is \[ b^D=(-i/2)^{\lfloor D/2\rfloor}b^{D\bmod2}, \] so it is a binary shift and fourth-root phase, with at most one further factor $b$. All phases, inverse wrappers, and scalar corrections above are exact Gaussian dyadic operations. Thus, once the physical binary basis changes and recursive stream layout are supplied, the complete parallel butterfly layer is exact up to its prescribed final truncation.

**S4.5**: Splitting padded rows cyclically among the $W$ roles gives each child call a stream of volume $V/W$ on a fixed number of tapes, with the scratch roles supplied by existing rows.
Source: "At a node, write a row index as \(u=Wg+w\), with \(0\le w<W\)," (paper)
> At a node, write a row index as \(u=Wg+w\), with \(0\le w<W\), and send that entire row to physical wire role \(w\), indexed there by \(g\). Every role stream has the same remaining address shape. Thus a pointwise gate reads the records with the same \(g\) and the same remaining address in its touched roles. The scalar network allows these role values to be arbitrary, so the split supplies its scratch roles from existing rows. Each recursive edge call acts on one role stream with volume exactly \(1/W\) of its parent's logical volume.

**S4.6**: The normalized cost satisfies $F(e)\le(s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)$ and unrolls, with $a=s/W<m^\lambda$, to $O(d^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$.
Source: "F(e)\le (s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)," (paper)
> \paragraph{Unrolling the recurrence.} Fix \(\beta=1/2\), and choose real exponents satisfying \[ 0<\tau<1,\qquad \max\{0,\log_m(s/W)\}\le\sigma<1, \qquad \max\{\tau,\sigma\}<\lambda<1, \qquad \tau(1+c/\beta)<\lambda. \] The exponents can all be chosen rational, with a strict upper bound in the condition on \(\sigma\). Stop recursion when \(e<d^\beta\) and apply the \(e\) \(C\) kernels individually. If \(F(e)\) denotes time divided by the current logical stream volume, then \[ F(e)\le (s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1), \qquad F(e)=O(e)\quad(e<d^\beta). \] Indeed, the \(s\) child calls are executed on streams of volume \(V/W\), so their total cost is \(s(V/W)F(e/m)\). Dividing by the current volume \(V\) gives the factor \(s/W\). At an internal node \(e\ge d^\beta\), hence \(K\le d^c\le e^{c/\beta}\). The overhead is therefore \(O(e^{\tau(1+c/\beta)}+1)=O(e^\lambda)\). Put \(a=s/W\). Since \(a\le m^\sigma<m^\lambda\), the internal costs sum to at most \[ C e^\lambda\sum_{j\ge0}(a/m^\lambda)^j=O(e^\lambda). \] If the leaves after \(j\) levels contain \(u=e/m^j<d^\beta\) active chunks each, their combined normalized contribution is at most \[ O(a^ju)\le O(e^\sigma u^{1-\sigma}) \le O(e^\sigma d^{\beta(1-\sigma)}). \] The first inequality uses \(a^j\le m^{j\sigma}=(e/u)^\sigma\). It also covers \(a<1\) by taking \(\sigma\ge0\).

**S4.8**: Since every row of $\mathcal H$ has absolute row sum one, $\mathcal H$ maps disk arrays to disk arrays, and the single final truncation $Q_p$ changes the result by less than $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$ in the maximum norm.
Source: "Finally, every row of $\mathcal H$ has" (paper)
> The guard-width calculation above bounds both denominator and magnitude growth by $\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil$. Since $d\le b_dp^\epsilon$ and $\epsilon C_1<1$, this is $o(p)$ uniformly over the allowed $d$, so every intermediate coefficient is represented exactly with the stated $O(p)$ width. The initial scan removes or adds only redundant leading sign bits and appends the reserved fractional zeros to put each supplied component in this guarded format. To truncate toward zero at the end, shift its absolute numerator right by the number of added fractional bits, restore its sign, and write the result in $w$ bits. These scans cost $O(V)$. Finally, every row of $\mathcal H$ has absolute row sum one. Thus $\mathcal H$ maps disk arrays to disk arrays, and componentwise truncation preserves that disk and has error less than $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$: truncation cannot increase the absolute value of either component, and changes each by less than $2^{-p}$. The truncated numerators have magnitude at most $2^p$, so the supplied component width can hold them. \end{proof} \section{Synthetic transforms and their tape layout} \label{sec:synthetic-layouts}

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S4.1 (on [Butterfly kernel H₀ and phase kernel C](butterfly-and-phase-kernels.md)): With $C=aI+bX$, $a=(1+i)/2$, $b=(1-i)/2$ and $\mathsf S=\operatorname{diag}(1,i)$, the two-point butterfly satisfies $H_0=b\,\mathsf SC\mathsf S$, and $C^2=X$, $C^4=I$.

- S4.7 (on [Exact Gaussian dyadic arithmetic and guard bits](guard-bits-dyadic.md)): A bound $\Delta=\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil$ on the arithmetic depth of the layer controls both denominator and magnitude growth, so $p+\Delta$ fractional and $\Delta+3$ integer bits represent every intermediate value exactly, and $\Delta=o(p)$.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and
$H_0$ acts coefficientwise." (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0035-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0035-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0035-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0035-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
