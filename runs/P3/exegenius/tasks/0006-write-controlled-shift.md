# exegenius task 0006-write-controlled-shift

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

## This page

Concept: Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings
Gloss: Updating a later address field y by y+a(controls) mod q^b, or multiplying it by a fixed rational unit, costs O(V) on tape by splitting each fibre in two pieces and merging them in swapped order.

## This page in the argument

The step: Updating a later address field $y$ by $y+a(\text{controls})$ modulo $q^b$, or multiplying it by a fixed rational unit, costs $O(V)$ by splitting each fibre in two pieces and merging them in swapped order.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time, with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers), use them for a fast synthetic-transform convolution over a polynomial ring, wrap that in the Gaussian-resampling, Bluestein and CRT reduction of integer multiplication, then recover the exact product and total the cost (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The two fast procedures rest on elementary linear-time scans on tape and on two finite linear networks with a rank saving.; how: state the elementary tape scans and the finite networks that both fast tape procedures reuse

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Arrays on tape and elementary stream operations](stream-ops.md): An array with a product address set is stored in lexicographic order on tape; splitting on a digit, merging, moving a digit and splitting whole rows cyclically into streams each cost O(V) for stored volume V.
  Shown as: Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings *<predicate>* Arrays on tape and elementary stream operations

## Pages that build on this one

- Bit network and the address shear: The XOR-only bit network with rational matrices M_v whose endpoint difference is the identity, so frames Φ_M (moving entry (H,D) to (H+MD,D)) make every role undergo the shear (H,D)↦(H+D,D).
- Lower-triangular (Bruhat) factorization: Every rational m×m matrix of rank a factors as E₁ΠE₂ with E₁,E₂ invertible lower triangular and Π a partial permutation with exactly a ones, matching the tape order of controlled shifts.
- Cost of a rational matrix shear: The shear (H,D)↦(H+AD,D) for a rank-a rational matrix A is done with exactly a interchanges of b-digit fields plus O(V) work, using triangular factors and three controlled updates per pivot.
- Packed addition of selected address bits: A binary row addition on corresponding selected bits of two address chunks, using a third chunk as restored scratch, is done by eight packed cyclic shifts plus deterministic repair of an exponentially small set of exceptional addresses.
- Chinese-remainder map to distinct prime axes: With pairwise coprime axis lengths s_i and product S, the map x ↦ ∏ x_i^{μ_i} is an isomorphism from C[x]/(x^S−1) to the multi-axis cyclic ring, converting one long cyclic convolution into a multidimensional one; on tape it is a sequence of triangular controlled shifts.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Controlled shifts and fixed rational scalings" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Controlled shifts and fixed rational scalings] \label{lem:ordered-affine-streams} Fix a prime $q$, a fixed number of control fields, and finitely many rational coefficients whose denominators are prime to $q$. Whenever a coefficient is used as a unit, also require its numerator to be prime to $q$. Put $Q=q^b$, $b\ge1$. Suppose a target field $y\in[Q]$ follows its control fields, each control used in an offset having $O(b)$ digits. An update \[ y\longmapsto y+a(\text{controls})\pmod Q \] costs $O(V)$ if the offset can be prepared in $b^{O(1)}$ time from the fixed number of control values. In particular, this holds for a fixed rational linear combination of them, specialized modulo $Q$. Multiplication of $y$ by any of the specified rational units, and its inverse, also costs $O(V)$. Arbitrarily long intervening spectator fields and suffix records are permitted. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0006-write-controlled-shift.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0006-write-controlled-shift.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0006-write-controlled-shift` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0006-write-controlled-shift`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
