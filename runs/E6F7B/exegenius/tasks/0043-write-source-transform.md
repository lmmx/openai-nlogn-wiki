Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F7B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Computed source transform
Gloss: The source Fourier transform R F_s is computed as 2^γ B₀ Q F_t A: Gaussian expansion on each line, the chirp transform (a twisted synthetic convolution) and Gaussian compression, then a power-of-two scaling, all with tracked disk margins and errors.

## This page in the argument

The step: The source transform $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ is computed as $2^\gamma\mathcal B_0 Q F_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A$ from Gaussian expansion, a chirp transform and Gaussian compression, with tracked errors.
How: Replace the middle factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ by the Bluestein chirp identity, evaluated with the twisted complex convolution, and wrap it in the line maps $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B_0$ and a power-of-two scaling.
Why: The middle transform is a Fourier transform of power-of-two length, which Bluestein's chirp identity reduces to convolution, and convolution is what the twist and the synthetic transforms compute. (the sources say so: "We next use the complex convolution to evaluate the middle factor" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)))$ approximates $QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$, with the permutation $Q$ absorbed.
- Applying $\mathcal A$ linewise, then the chirp transform, then $\mathcal B_0$, then exact multiplication by $2^\gamma$ computes $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ on a disk grid source tensor.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Keep the transform-based multiplication of Harvey and van der Hoeven (Gaussian resampling, Bluestein chirp, synthetic polynomial transforms) but replace its two costly tape operations, address rearrangement and butterfly layers, by faster procedures obtained from rank-saving linear networks, then check exactness and total cost. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The algorithm of digit extraction, address map to prime axes, two source transforms, truncated pointwise product, opposite-sign transform, rescaling by $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$, rounding, inverse address map and carries produces the exact $2n$-bit product.; how: Turn the product into a radix-digit convolution, place it on prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map, compute the convolution through the three source transforms, and prove that rounding recovers the integer coefficients. (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S4.6.1, S4.6.2). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S4.6.1**: The chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)))$ approximates $QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$, with the permutation $Q$ absorbed.
Source: "Thus $\widetilde a$ is the convolution kernel and $x_0$ is the data" (paper)
> Let $\widetilde a$ be the resulting disk-grid array, so $\|\widetilde a-a\|_\infty<2\,2^{-p}$. For a disk-grid target tensor $x$ of norm at most $.6$, the computed chirp transform forms the arrays \[ \begin{aligned} x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x),\\ y_0&=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0),\\ \widetilde{\mathscr C}(x) &=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}y_0). \end{aligned} \] Thus $\widetilde a$ is the convolution kernel and $x_0$ is the data operand after the first endpoint phase. Replacing the approximations by exact phases and exact convolution gives $\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}\mathcal M_{\mathbb C} (a,\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}x)=QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$ by \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp}. Below we show that $\|x\|_\infty\le.6$ implies $\|x_0\|_\infty\le.6$, which supplies the smaller operand required by the computed convolution.

**S4.6.2**: Applying $\mathcal A$ linewise, then the chirp transform, then $\mathcal B_0$, then exact multiplication by $2^\gamma$ computes $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ on a disk grid source tensor.
Source: "For a source disk-grid tensor of norm at most $.5$, write" (paper)
> For a source disk-grid tensor of norm at most $.5$, write $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ for the following procedure: apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal A$, apply the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$, apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal B_0$, and multiply the grid numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$. Its exact counterpart is \[ \mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A =RF_{\boldsymbol s}. \] Here an exact counterpart replaces every numerical subroutine by the exact map it approximates and omits truncations. The source arrays are stored in the padded power-of-two box, with zeros outside the valid source coordinates. The compressed scalar output uses $w_{\rm c}$-bit components. Appending $\gamma$ zero bits to each word gives the exact scaled numerator in the known signed width $w_{\rm c}+\gamma$. For the stated input norm, the disk estimate below proves that every scaled coordinate still belongs to $\mathbb D_p$. Its component numerators therefore have magnitude at most $2^p$, so a scan removes only leading sign-extension bits and returns the same integers in $w_{\rm c}$ bits. This scan costs $O(T(w_{\rm c}+\gamma))=O(Tp)$ and leaves the padded zero records zero. Define the opposite-sign procedure by \[ \widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z) =\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}; \] its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Tensor resampling on the padded box](padded-box-tensor-resampling.md): Resampling in d dimensions applies the one-dimensional maps line by line on a zero-padded box of T = Πt_i entries, exposing each axis with address-chunk interchanges, at total cost O(d T p^{3/2+δ} α) plus O(Tp d²(1+ℓ^τ)) for movement.

- [Coefficient twist from cyclic to negacyclic](phase-twist.md): Multiplying coefficient k by ζ^k with ζ = e^{πi/r} maps ℂ[x]/(x^r − 1) isomorphically onto the negacyclic ring, turning the last cyclic axis into a polynomial ring; its negative wrap gives the cyclic wrap after untwisting.

- [Convolution from the retained transform layout](synthetic-convolution.md): Two forward synthetic transforms in layout order, a pointwise ring product divided by r, the opposite transform and an exact scaling by M compute the normalized convolution (f*g)/T over the negacyclic ring with error below √2 M(3ℓ+1)2^{−p}.

## Pages that build on this one

- Precision budget and exact recovery: Scale bookkeeping (the two factors S) and the error bound 448 b 2^{−b+γ} < 1/2 show that each recovered convolution coefficient rounds to the true integer, which is below 2^{3b}, so carries give the exact product.
- The multiplication algorithm: Digit extraction, the address map Φ to prime axes, two source transforms, a truncated pointwise product, the opposite-sign transform, rescaling by S and 2^{2b+4}, rounding, inverse address map and carry propagation, producing the 2n-bit product.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A" (paper)

  > For a source disk-grid tensor of norm at most $.5$, write $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ for the following procedure: apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal A$, apply the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$, apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal B_0$, and multiply the grid numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$. Its exact counterpart is \[ \mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A =RF_{\boldsymbol s}. \] Here an exact counterpart replaces every numerical subroutine by the exact map it approximates and omits truncations. The source arrays are stored in the padded power-of-two box, with zeros outside the valid source coordinates. The compressed scalar output uses $w_{\rm c}$-bit components.

- "Put $\mathcal R=\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ and" (paper)

  > The power-of-two complex convolution used in the chirp identity is obtained from the synthetic convolution by a coefficient twist. Put $\mathcal R=\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ and $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$. The map \[ \Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\longrightarrow\mathcal R, \qquad x_d\longmapsto\zeta y \] is well defined, since $(\zeta y)^r=(-1)(-1)=1$. On the bases $(x_d^k)_{0\le k<r}$ and $(y^k)_{0\le k<r}$ it is diagonal, multiplying coefficient $k$ by the nonzero number $\zeta^k$. It is therefore an isomorphism, with inverse multiplying that coefficient by $\zeta^{-k}$. Both exact maps preserve the coefficient sup norm. For an explicit check on the wrap, write $k+l=j+hr$, where $h\in\{0,1\}$. A product term after twisting and negacyclic reduction has factor \[ \zeta^{k+l}(-1)^h=\zeta^j(\zeta^r)^h(-1)^h=\zeta^j. \] Untwisting therefore recovers the cyclic coefficient with the correct

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0043-write-source-transform.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0043-write-source-transform.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0043-write-source-transform` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0043-write-source-transform`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
