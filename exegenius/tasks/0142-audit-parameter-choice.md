# exegenius task 0142-audit-parameter-choice

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file and the paper at `sources/paper.tex`: do not read other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Fidelity: also check that the page's mathematics is right, and report what is wrong even where this reader could follow it. For each claim that states a definition, a hypothesis, a step of a proof, a value or a conclusion, work out what it assumes and what it concludes, and check it against everything this task file gives: the page's definitions, its other claims and its quotations. Report as a `step` any claim that is false, inconsistent with another statement on the page, stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it, or missing a hypothesis it needs. Quote the claim, and say in the note what is wrong and what the correct statement is.

The source: the paper this page explains is at `sources/paper.tex` (LaTeX). For each such claim, also find the passage of the paper that states, defines or proves it (search the file for the claim's terms and symbols, then read the passage around each match) and compare: every hypothesis present, the same scope and quantifiers, the same constants, signs, exponents and inequality directions, a conclusion no stronger than the paper's, and the right result, lemma or author credited. Report any mismatch as a `step` in the same way, and give the paper's line number in the note.

What counts as an error: report a claim as wrong only if, as this page states it, it is false; inconsistent with the page; stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it; missing a hypothesis without which it is false; given a wrong value, sign, exponent, constant, quantifier or credit; or presented as following from something it does not follow from. Do not report a correct statement as wrong because it is informal, abbreviated or simplified, uses a word in the paper's own sense, or leaves a technical precondition to another page or to the paper. If the paper's own summary of the same step states it the same way, it is not an error.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is a computer science undergraduate: they have taken discrete mathematics, an algorithms course (asymptotics, divide and conquer, schoolbook and Karatsuba multiplication, sorting), a first linear algebra course (vector spaces, subspaces, dimension, rank, matrices as linear maps, inverses, triangular matrices, orthogonality, bilinear forms at a basic level), calculus, elementary number theory (primes, gcd, modular arithmetic) and basic machine-level binary representation (XOR, two's complement). They have seen Turing machines with tapes only at an introductory level.

# Parameter and prime-length choice

Parameter and prime-length choice fixes, for $n$-bit inputs, every exponent and size so that the hypotheses of the butterfly-layer and resampling lemmas hold at once.

The exponents are fixed rationals, so inequalities among them are integer comparisons. In the [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-layer.md), $\tau$ and $\sigma$ bound chunk-interchange cost and recursion growth, $\beta$ sets the threshold $d^\beta$ of active chunks handled singly, $\lambda$ is the per-node overhead exponent, $\lambda'$ the final cost exponent of $Vd^{\lambda'}$ on bit volume $V$, $c$ and $\epsilon$ the chunk-width and axis-count exponents, $C_1$ the guard-bit exponent, and $\delta$ the resampling-cost exponent.

Take $\tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50}$, $\beta=1/2$ and $\delta=1/16$. Take $\lambda=1-2^{-52}$ and $c=2^{-56}$. Take $\lambda'=1-2^{-54}$. Take $C_1=20$, $\epsilon=2^{-75}$ and $\kappa=2^{-182}$. These are deliberately conservative (cited)

The layer needs $\max\{\tau,\sigma\}<\lambda<1$, $\tau(1+c/\beta)<\lambda$, $\max\{\lambda,\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)\}<\lambda'<1$ and $\epsilon C_1<1$. The layer conditions hold with room to spare: $\tau(1+c/\beta)<1-31\cdot2^{-55}<\lambda$, since $\tau(1+c/\beta)=(1-2^{-50})(1+2^{-55})=1-31\cdot2^{-55}-2^{-105}$ and $\lambda=1-8\cdot2^{-55}$. Also $\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)=1-2^{-51}<\lambda<\lambda'<1$, and $\epsilon C_1=20\cdot2^{-75}<1$.

For large $n$ put $b=\lceil\log_2n\rceil$, $p=6b$, $d=\lfloor b^\epsilon\rfloor$. Put $K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor$, the address-chunk width in bits. So $p$ sets the precision of the [Fixed-point Gaussian dyadic records](fixed-point.md), and $d$ counts the axes. Take the power of two $T$ in $[4n/b,8n/b)$.

Let $r=2^{\lceil(\log_2T)/d\rceil}$ and $\ell=\log_2r$; choose $d\ell-\log_2T\in[0,d)$ of the axis lengths to be $r/2$ and the others $r$, with the last axis of length $r$. The count lies in $[0,d)$ as $\ell$ rounds $(\log_2T)/d$ up, so some axis has length $r$; the product is $r^d/2^{d\ell-\log_2T}=T$. Thus $t_i\in\{r/2,r\}$, $\prod_it_i=T$ and $t_d=r$.

The lemmas assume $a_dp^\epsilon\le d\le b_dp^\epsilon$, $2^{a_rp/d}\le r\le2^{b_rp/d}$ and $d\ell\le C_\ell p$, with constants $a_d,b_d,a_r,b_r,C_\ell$. Since $2^{b-1}<n\le2^b$, the range of $T$ gives $b/2\le\log_2T\le b$ for large $b$. With $b^\epsilon/2\le d\le b^\epsilon\le b$ this yields $\frac1{12}p^\epsilon\le d\le p^\epsilon$ and $\frac p{12d}\le\ell\le\frac p{3d}$. These choices give $Tp=\Theta(n)$, $d=\Theta(p^\epsilon)$, $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$, $\ell=\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})$, $r=2^{\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})}$, so the comparison constants $a_d=a_r=1/12$, $b_d=1$, $b_r=1/3$, $C_\ell=1$ can be fixed for all lengths at once.

Put $\alpha=\lceil(12d^2b)^{1/4}\rceil$. Put $\gamma=2d\alpha^2$ and $\eta=1/(4d)$, the relative distance of each prime $s_i$ below $t_i$. Here $\alpha$ sets the Gaussian width of [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md). As $\lceil x\rceil\le2x$ for real $x\ge1$ and $8\sqrt{12}<28$, then $\gamma<28d^2\sqrt b\le28b^{1/2+2\epsilon}\le28b^{2/3}$, so $2\le\alpha<\sqrt p$ eventually and $\gamma=o(b)$.

By the prime-interval lemma, for $0<\eta<1/4$ and real $x>e^{2/\eta}$ the interval of integers $q$ with $(1-2\eta)x<q\le(1-\eta)x$ contains at least $\eta x/(2\log x)$ primes (cited); both $x=r/2$ and $x=r$ qualify since $\log x>8d=2/\eta$, and the count $x/(8d\log x)$ exceeds $d$. Indeed $\log(r/2)/d=\Theta(p^{1-2\epsilon})\to\infty$, and $x>8d^2\log x$ because $\log(8d^2\log x)=\Theta(\log p)=o(\log x)$.

The intervals are disjoint since $(1-\eta)r/2<(1-2\eta)r$. Choose distinct odd primes with $(1-2\eta)t_i<s_i\le(1-\eta)t_i$; $\gcd(s_i,t_i)=1$ as $t_i$ is a power of two. Put $S=\prod_is_i$; this choice supplies the prime axis lengths of the [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-map.md). Multiplying the lower bounds and applying strict Bernoulli, $(1-x)^d>1-dx$, gives $S/T>(1-1/(2d))^d>1/2$ for $d\ge2$. With $s_i<t_i$ this gives $T/2<S<T$.

With the relative gap $\theta_i=t_i/s_i-1\ge\eta/(1-\eta)>\eta$ we get $\alpha^4\theta_i>12d^2b/(4d)=3db\ge6b=p$, the separation hypothesis of the resampling lemma; also $t_i\le r\le T<2^p$.

Trial division of at most $r$ candidates by at most $\sqrt r$ divisors costs $dr^{3/2}\operatorname{poly}(p)$ with logarithm $\Theta(p/d)=o(p)$. The deterministic search for the primes takes $n^{o(1)}=o(n)$ time, since its logarithm is $o(p)$ and $p=\Theta(\log n)$; all primes and length parameters are generated by the machine, not given as advice.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0142-audit-parameter-choice.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0142-audit-parameter-choice` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0142-audit-parameter-choice`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
