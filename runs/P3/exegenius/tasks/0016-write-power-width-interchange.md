# exegenius task 0016-write-power-width-interchange

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Power-width chunk interchange and the recursive saving
Gloss: For chunks of e=m^k digits, running the bit network on W row-split role streams, with each edge done by smaller interchanges, gives F_k ≤ (s/W)F_{k−1}+O(1); because s/W<m^τ this yields cost O(V e^τ).

## This page in the argument

The step: For $e=m^k$, two disjoint chunks of $e$ radix-$q$ digits can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time when the row field is divisible by $W^k$, where $\tau<1$ satisfies $s/W<m^\tau$.
How: run the bit network on $W$ row-split role streams with each edge done as a matrix shear by smaller interchanges, and solve the resulting recurrence
Why: A recursive call at parameter $mf$ uses $s$ calls at parameter $f$ on streams of volume $V/W$, so dividing by volume multiplies the recursive contribution by $s/W<m$. (the sources say so: "increases the recursive contribution by $s/W<m$. This strict inequality" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ for a rank-$a$ rational matrix $A$ takes exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ work. (on [Cost of a rational matrix shear](matrix-shear.md))
- Split rows cyclically into $W$ role streams, apply the frame shear $\Phi_{A_e}$ on every edge and each gate pointwise; the frame identity gives $H\leftarrow H+D$ on every row, and the updates $D\leftarrow D-H$, $H\leftarrow H+D$, $D\leftarrow H-D$ turn this into the interchange.
- There are $s$ recursive calls, each on a stream of volume $V/W$, so the time per unit volume satisfies $F_0=O(1)$ and $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$.
- Since $s/W<m^\tau$, the geometric sum $\sum_{j\le k}(s/W)^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$, hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time, with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers), use them for a fast synthetic-transform convolution over a polynomial ring, wrap that in the Gaussian-resampling, Bluestein and CRT reduction of integer multiplication, then recover the exact product and total the cost (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Interchanging two disjoint $u$-bit address fields of an array whose addresses form a complete product costs $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$, where $V$ is the stored volume.; how: recursion on the chunk width through the bit network's shear, first for power widths with enough rows and then for arbitrary widths (on [Chunk interchange in O(V uᵗ) time](chunk-interchange.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.1.2, S1.1.3, S1.1.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.1.2**: Split rows cyclically into $W$ role streams, apply the frame shear $\Phi_{A_e}$ on every edge and each gate pointwise; the frame identity gives $H\leftarrow H+D$ on every row, and the updates $D\leftarrow D-H$, $H\leftarrow H+D$, $D\leftarrow H-D$ turn this into the interchange.
Source: "Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix" (paper)
> Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix preceding the row field. Write the original row number as $r=Wg+(w-1)$ with $1\le w\le W$; stream $w$ has row number $g$. These streams have exactly the same remaining shape, including the full ranges of $H$ and $D$. Each has logical volume $V/W$, and its row count is divisible by $W^{k-1}$.

**S1.1.3**: There are $s$ recursive calls, each on a stream of volume $V/W$, so the time per unit volume satisfies $F_0=O(1)$ and $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$.
Source: "F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)." (paper)
> The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$. Each acts on one role stream of volume $V/W$, retaining all other fields as spectators. Splitting, merging, gates, and triangular operations have total cost $O(V)$ because their number is fixed. Below we verify that scheduling the recursive calls on fixed tapes also costs $O(V)$ at this node. Thus if $F_k$ is a uniform upper bound for time divided by logical volume, then \begin{equation} \label{eq:swap-recurrence} F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1). \end{equation} For $a=s/W<m^\tau$ the geometric sum $\sum_{j=0}^k a^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$. If $a\le1$, the sum is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; if $a>1$, it is $O(a^k)$. Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.

**S1.1.4**: Since $s/W<m^\tau$, the geometric sum $\sum_{j\le k}(s/W)^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$, hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.
Source: "Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$." (paper)

If $a\le1$, the sum is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; if $a>1$, it is $O(a^k)$. Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S1.1.1 (on [Cost of a rational matrix shear](matrix-shear.md)): The shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ for a rank-$a$ rational matrix $A$ takes exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ work.

## Pages that build on this one

- Chunk interchange in O(V uᵗ) time: Interchanging two disjoint u-bit address fields of an array in which all address combinations occur costs O(V u^τ) for a fixed τ<1, via XOR-style intermediate steps whose final effect is an exact permutation.
- Simultaneous butterfly layer in O(V d^λ′) time: Applying H₀ to the same bit position in d address chunks of polynomial records at once, exactly in Gaussian dyadics with guard bits and one final truncation, costs O(V d^{λ′}) with λ′<1 instead of d passes.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)." (paper)

  > The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$. Each acts on one role stream of volume $V/W$, retaining all other fields as spectators. Splitting, merging, gates, and triangular operations have total cost $O(V)$ because their number is fixed. Below we verify that scheduling the recursive calls on fixed tapes also costs $O(V)$ at this node. Thus if $F_k$ is a uniform upper bound for time divided by logical volume, then \begin{equation} \label{eq:swap-recurrence} F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1). \end{equation} For $a=s/W<m^\tau$ the geometric sum $\sum_{j=0}^k a^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$. If $a\le1$, the sum is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; if $a>1$, it is $O(a^k)$. Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.

- "The chunks can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time, preserving every" (paper)

  > \begin{proposition}[Power-width interchange with rows] \label{prop:power-interchange} Assume the fixed circuit data satisfy \eqref{eq:finite-shear-contract}, and let $q$ be a prime as in Lemma~\ref{lem:matrix-shear} for its edge matrices, also avoiding the denominators of every assigned terminal and gate matrix $M$. Choose a rational number $\tau\in(0,1)$ with $s/W<m^\tau$. For every $e=m^k$, $k\ge0$, consider two disjoint contiguous address chunks of $e$ radix-$q$ digits each. Suppose a row field preceding both chunks has length divisible by $W^k$. There may be additional fields before and after the row field, between the chunks, and after them. The chunks can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time, preserving every other address field, on a fixed number of finite-alphabet tapes. The constant is independent of all field lengths and of the data. \end{proposition}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-power-width-interchange.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-power-width-interchange.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0016-write-power-width-interchange` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-power-width-interchange`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
