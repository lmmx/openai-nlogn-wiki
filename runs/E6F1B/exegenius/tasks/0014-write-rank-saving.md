Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F1B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Rank deficit s < Wm
Gloss: Summing the dimension changes (edge ranks) of all labels gives a total s of smaller calls strictly below W·m, where W is the number of wires and m the dimension, which is the source of the power saving.

## This page in the argument

The step: Summing the dimension changes of all labels gives a total $s$ of smaller calls strictly below $Wm$, because only the central-wire edges from time 3 to time 4 decrease and the loss ratio $L/N$ is below $1/2$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- There is one deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine multiplying $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: build two fast tape procedures from linear networks with a rank saving, insert them into a Gaussian-resampling and chirp reduction of the digit convolution to a ring convolution, and balance all parameters (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- There are two fixed linear networks, a bit network on $\mathbb F_2$ with address shears and a complex phase network, that exchange two banks of values, restore every scratch wire, and need a total number $s$ of smaller calls strictly below $Wm$.; how: build a fixed exchange network on wires, give its gates frames and nested subspace labels, and count the dimension changes along its edges

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Three-element-subset subspace labels](subset-labels.md): Subspaces of a tensor-cube bilinear space attached to gates, built from indicator vectors of three-element subsets with intersection-size pairings (Frankl–Wilson, Alon), so labels are nested along edges and neighbors are orthogonal.
  Shown as: Rank deficit s < Wm *<predicate>* Three-element-subset subspace labels
- [Frames and the common-frame identity](frames.md): Giving each array on a wire an invertible address-space operator (a frame) at every vertex; because a common frame commutes with a pointwise linear gate, the network's overall effect is the endpoint frames applied to each role, and each edge only changes the frame.
  Shown as: Rank deficit s < Wm *<predicate>* Frames and the common-frame identity

## Pages that build on this one

- Bit exchange network with shear interface: The F₂ network with rational labels whose frames are address shears: its endpoint operator is (H,D)→(H+D,D) on every role, using only XOR gates, with rank sum s_b < W_b m.
- Power-saving recurrence: Calling s smaller operations of parameter f/m on streams of volume V/W gives normalized cost F_k ≤ (s/W)F_{k−1}+O(1); since s/W < m^τ this solves to O(e^τ), a strict power saving.
- Complex phase network: The Z[i,1/2] network with binary labels whose frames are phase operators C_U = H^{⊗m} diag(i^{wt(P_U x) mod 4}) H^{⊗m}; each edge is a product of two-point kernels aI+bX_v and the endpoint operator is C^{⊗m} on every role, with s_c < W_c m.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$." (paper)

  > The finite construction in Section~\ref{sec:finite-networks} attaches subspaces of a fixed $m$-dimensional space to its gates and terminals. The subspaces at adjacent vertices are nested. Their dimension changes count the smaller operations needed on an edge, with an additional source contribution in the bit construction. The construction uses three-element subsets: gather and scatter create coefficients depending on intersection size, and auxiliary wires cancel the unwanted coefficients. Orthogonality of the corresponding indicator vectors permits the subspace assignments. The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0014-write-rank-saving.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0014-write-rank-saving.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0014-write-rank-saving` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0014-write-rank-saving`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
