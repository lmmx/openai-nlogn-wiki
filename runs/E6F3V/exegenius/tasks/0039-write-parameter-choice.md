Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F3V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Parameter choice for the multiplier
Gloss: Fixed rational exponents (τ, σ, λ′, c, ε, δ, κ) and sizes b = ⌈log₂n⌉, p = 6b, d = ⌊b^ε⌋, K = ⌊d^c⌋, T ≈ n/b, r = 2^ℓ, with prime axis lengths s_i < t_i.

## This page in the argument

The step: Fixed rational exponents $(\tau,\sigma,\lambda',c,\epsilon,\delta,\kappa)$ and sizes $b=\lceil\log_2n\rceil$, $p=6b$, $d=\lfloor b^\epsilon\rfloor$, $K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor$, $T\in[4n/b,8n/b)$ a power of two, $r=2^\ell$ with axis lengths $t_i\in\{r/2,r\}$, and prime lengths $s_i<t_i$, make $Tp=\Theta(n)$ and satisfy every condition of the earlier procedures.
How: Fix all exponents as explicit rationals, then define the sizes from $n$ so that the padded array holds $\Theta(n)$ bits, the number of axes $d$ grows like $p^\epsilon$, and the record length $r$ grows faster than every fixed power of $p$.
Why: The procedures proved earlier each need conditions on their parameters, so compatible parameters must be chosen before the integer coefficients can be recovered and the remaining tape operations accounted for. (the sources say so: "We choose compatible parameters for these procedures, recover
the integer coefficients from their approximations, and account for the
remaining tape operations." (paper))
Striking feature: The exponents are astronomically small ($\epsilon=2^{-75}$, $c=2^{-56}$) but fixed: they keep $d$ growing slowly while $r=2^{\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})}$ still dominates every polynomial in $p$. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Take $\tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50}$, $\beta=1/2$, $\delta=1/16$, $\lambda=1-2^{-52}$, $c=2^{-56}$, $\lambda'=1-2^{-54}$, $C_1=20$, $\epsilon=2^{-75}$, $\kappa=2^{-182}$.
- For large $n$ put $b=\lceil\log_2n\rceil$, $p=6b$, $d=\lfloor b^\epsilon\rfloor$ and $K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor$.
- Take the power of two $T$ in $[4n/b,8n/b)$, $r=2^{\lceil(\log_2T)/d\rceil}$, and choose axis lengths in $\{r/2,r\}$ with product $T$ and $t_d=r$.
- These give $Tp=\Theta(n)$, $d=\Theta(p^\epsilon)$, $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$, $\ell=\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})$ and $r=2^{\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})}$.
- Distinct odd primes $s_i$ with $(1-2\eta)t_i<s_i\le(1-\eta)t_i$ exist, have product $S$ with $T/2<S<T$, and ratios $t_i/s_i$ large enough that $\alpha^4\theta_i>p$ for $\theta_i=t_i/s_i-1$. (on [Prime axis lengths near powers of two](prime-axis-lengths.md))

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution of short digits evaluated by Fourier transforms, speed up the two costly ingredients (moving data between addresses, and butterfly arithmetic) by a power of a block size using one recursive saving, and total every cost term. (on [Sub-n-log-n integer multiplication](main-theorem.md))
- Digits of $x$ and $y$ are placed on prime cyclic axes by the Chinese-remainder map, transformed by Gaussian resampling around a chirp convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, multiplied pointwise, transformed with opposite sign, rescaled, rounded and carried to give the exact $2n$-bit product.; how: Follow the chain of reductions: radix-digit convolution, then cyclic convolution on distinct prime axes, then normalised convolution on power-of-two axes, then convolution over the polynomial ring, and account for every change of representation and its error. (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S6.1.2, S6.1.3, S6.1.4, S6.1.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S6.1.2**: Take $\tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50}$, $\beta=1/2$, $\delta=1/16$, $\lambda=1-2^{-52}$, $c=2^{-56}$, $\lambda'=1-2^{-54}$, $C_1=20$, $\epsilon=2^{-75}$, $\kappa=2^{-182}$.

Take the following fixed rational numbers: \begin{equation}\label{eq:fixed-parameters} \begin{gathered} \tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50},\qquad \beta=\frac12,\qquad \delta=\frac1{16},\\ \lambda=1-2^{-52},\qquad c=2^{-56},\qquad \lambda'=1-2^{-54},\\ C_1=20,\qquad \epsilon=2^{-75},\qquad \kappa=2^{-182}. \end{gathered} \end{equation} These constants are deliberately conservative; no optimization is claimed.

Choose $d\ell-\log_2T$ of the $d$ axis lengths to be $r/2$ and the others to be $r$. This gives \[ t_i\in\{r/2,r\},\qquad \prod_i t_i=T,\qquad t_d=r. \] Indeed $d\ell-\log_2T$ is an integer in $[0,d)$, so at least one axis has length $r$; choose it as the last axis. These definitions give \begin{equation}\label{eq:sizes} Tp=\Theta(n),\quad d=\Theta(p^\epsilon),\quad K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c}),\quad \ell=\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon}),\quad r=2^{\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})}. \end{equation} The comparison constants can be fixed for every input length at once.

Their pointwise bounds cover every computed pair $(d,r)$, including all choices arising at the same $p$. These bounds also give that $r$ exceeds every fixed power of $p$, $K/\log p\to\infty$, and $\ell/K\to\infty$. There are eventually enough axe

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-parameter-choice.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-parameter-choice.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0039-write-parameter-choice` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-parameter-choice`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
