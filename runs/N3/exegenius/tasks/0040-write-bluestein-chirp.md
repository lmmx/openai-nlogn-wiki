Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e5/N3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Bluestein's chirp identity
Gloss: The identity Q F_t u = ā · (a * (ā · u))/T with chirp a_j = exp(−πi Σ s_i j_i²/t_i), converting the middle transform together with its target permutation into a normalized cyclic convolution and two pointwise phase multiplications.

## This page in the argument

The step: With chirp $a$, $QF_{\boldsymbol t}u=\overline a\cdot(a*(\overline a\cdot u))/T$, so the middle transform with its target permutation is a normalized cyclic convolution.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine computes the exact product of two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in that model.; how: build two sublinear-per-level tape procedures from finite linear networks with a rank deficit, then chain the known reductions from integer product to synthetic polynomial transforms and bound every cost (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Exact multiplication of two $n$-bit integers reduces to synthetic transforms and packed ring products whose total cost is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.; how: compute synthetic transforms with the fast layers, build normalized ring convolution, express prime-length transforms by resampling with retained permutations and chirps, then assemble radix digits, the CRT map, the twist, precision and parameters

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Resampling with retained permutations](no-sort-resampling.md): The form P_s F_s = 2^{2α²} B₀ P_t F_t A of Gaussian resampling, and its tensor version R F_s = 2^γ 𝓑₀ Q F_t 𝓐, in which the source and target coordinate permutations stay inside the transform formula instead of being executed as sorts.
  Shown as: Bluestein's chirp identity *<predicate>* Resampling with retained permutations
- [Cyclic convolution](cyclic-convolution.md): The product in C[x]/(x^S − 1), or its multidimensional analogue on a product of cyclic axes, which Fourier transforms turn into pointwise multiplication.
  Shown as: Bluestein's chirp identity *<predicate>* Cyclic convolution

## Pages that build on this one

- Integer multiplication below n log n: There is one deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine computing the exact product of two n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) worst-case time with κ = 2^{−182}, by chaining radix-digit convolution, a CRT address map, Gaussian resampling with retained permutations, Bluestein chirps, a coefficient twist and synthetic transforms accelerated by fast chunk interchanges and simultaneous butterfly layers; this disproves the n log n optimality conjecture in that model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution." (paper)

  > Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution. A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$; its negative wrap gives precisely the original cyclic wrap after the twist is removed. Sections~\ref{sec:synthetic-layouts} and~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products} compute convolution on the remaining axes over this polynomial ring. The two forward synthetic transforms retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes that order. Their polynomial products use signed packing and the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine.

- "The chirp identity below performs the frequency change in $Q$ without applying $Q$ as a separate permutation of the array." (paper)

  > The factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ in \eqref{eq:no-sort-tensor} can be computed from a cyclic convolution and two pointwise phase multiplications. The chirp identity below performs the frequency change in $Q$ without applying $Q$ as a separate permutation of the array. The second identity shows how the retained source permutation $R$ cancels when computing a convolution. Here $*$ denotes cyclic convolution on the product of the coordinate groups and a dot denotes coordinatewise multiplication.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0040-write-bluestein-chirp.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0040-write-bluestein-chirp.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0040-write-bluestein-chirp` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0040-write-bluestein-chirp`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
