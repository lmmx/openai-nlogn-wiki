Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F5V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, counting, induction, primes, gcd), a first algorithms course (divide and conquer, recurrences, sorting, Karatsuba multiplication, schoolbook arithmetic) and complexity (big-O family, single- and multitape Turing machines), together with calculus (exponentials, logarithms, series), linear algebra over the reals and complex numbers, and polynomials.

## This page

Concept: Elementary stream operations
Gloss: Linear-time scans on fixed tapes that permute digit values, move one digit, split a stream on a digit, apply a pointwise map to aligned streams and merge, or split whole rows cyclically among W streams.

## This page in the argument

The step: Four basic stream operations (permuting two digit values, moving one digit, split-map-merge on a digit, and cyclic row splitting into $W$ streams) each cost $O(V)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, using fast address interchange and fast simultaneous butterfly layers inside a Gaussian-resampling, chirp and synthetic-transform reduction.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution evaluated through Gaussian-resampled, chirped synthetic transforms, make the two costly tape operations (address movement and butterfly layers) cheaper by a power of the logarithm using networks with a rank saving, and then assemble the algorithm and add up its costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Moving a digit, splitting a stream on a digit, cyclically splitting rows among $W$ streams and merging them, and cyclically shifting or rescaling a later field by control fields all take $O(V)$ steps on a fixed number of tapes.; how: Prove two lemmas on single scans with counters, splitting into streams and merging.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Arrays, address fields and logical volume](array-layout.md): Data is stored as a stream in lexicographic address order over a product of fields; the logical volume V counts stored bits and rows are consecutive blocks over a suffix field.
  Shown as: Elementary stream operations *<predicate>* Arrays, address fields and logical volume

## Pages that build on this one

- Controlled cyclic shifts and rational scalings: A later target field can be shifted cyclically by an offset computed from earlier control fields, or multiplied by a unit modulo q^b, in linear time by splitting and merging blocks.
- Power-width address interchange: Two chunks of m^k radix-q digits are interchanged by splitting rows into W role streams, running the bit network with each edge shear done by recursive interchanges of chunks of 1/m the width, in O(V e^τ) time on fixed tapes.
- Packed selected-bit addition: An XOR of the same bit position in f chunks of one address range into another is done together by a constant number of cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges, followed by a deterministic repair of the small explicitly identified set of exceptional addresses.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Each of the following operations on an array of volume $V$ takes $O(V)$ steps on a fixed number of one-dimensional tapes:" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Elementary stream operations] \label{lem:elementary-streams} Fix a radix $q\ge2$. Each of the following operations on an array of volume $V$ takes $O(V)$ steps on a fixed number of one-dimensional tapes: \begin{enumerate} \item any fixed permutation of the pair of digit values at two specified radix-$q$ positions, whether or not the positions are adjacent; \item moving one specified radix-$q$ digit to another position, preserving the order of the intervening positions; \item splitting on a specified radix-$q$ digit, applying a fixed pointwise map to aligned streams, and merging them back; \item for positive integers $P,R,B$, within each prefix of an array on $[P]\times[R]\times[B]$, splitting whole rows cyclically into a fixed number $W$ of streams, and, when $W$ divides $R$, merging those streams in any fixed order of the row classes. \end{enumerate} The bounds include shape preparation, counter initialization and resets, and returning or clearing the visited portions of work tapes. Their constants may depend on the fixed radix, the fixed pointwise map, and the fixed number of row classes. \end{lemma}

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-elementary-streams.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-elementary-streams.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0010-write-elementary-streams` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-elementary-streams`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
