# exegenius task 0417-audit-chinese-remainder-theorem

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Chinese remainder theorem

The Chinese remainder theorem says when a system of congruences has a solution, and how many solutions it has. It is the arithmetic fact behind the [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md), which relabels the positions of a [cyclic convolution](cyclic-convolution.md) so that it becomes a multidimensional one.

The theorem concerns a system of [congruences](congruence-modulo.md) with pairwise coprime moduli. Let $\chi$ be the number of congruences in the system. Here $\nu$ is an index numbering the congruences, running from $1$ to $\chi$. For each $\nu$, let $\kappa_\nu$ be the modulus of the $\nu$-th congruence, a positive integer, and let $\delta_\nu$ be its residue, an integer. The unknown is an integer $\tau$, which is a solution when it satisfies every congruence below:

$$\tau \equiv \delta_\nu \pmod{\kappa_\nu} \qquad \text{for every } \nu=1,\dots,\chi.$$

The theorem requires moduli that are pairwise [coprime](coprime.md). Every two of $\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_\chi$ have greatest common divisor $1$. Let $\Lambda=\kappa_1\kappa_2\cdots\kappa_\chi$ be the product of the moduli, a positive integer.

The statement is this. If the moduli are pairwise coprime, then the system has a solution, and an integer $\tau'$ is also a solution exactly when $\tau'\equiv\tau \pmod{\Lambda}$. So the solutions form one residue class modulo $\Lambda$.

Coprimality cannot be dropped. Take the two moduli $2$ and $4$ with residues $0$ and $1$. The first congruence says $\tau$ is even and the second says $\tau$ is odd, so no solution exists.

For uniqueness, suppose $\tau$ and $\tau'$ are both solutions. Then every $\kappa_\nu$ divides $\tau-\tau'$. Take a prime $p$ with $p^e$ exactly dividing $\Lambda$. Because the moduli are pairwise coprime, $p$ divides exactly one modulus $\kappa_\nu$, and writing $\Lambda=\kappa_\nu R$ with $p$ not dividing $R$ gives $p^e\mid\kappa_\nu$. Hence $p^e$ divides $\tau-\tau'$. Doing this for every prime in $\Lambda$ shows $\Lambda$ divides $\tau-\tau'$.

For existence, fix $\nu$. No prime divides both $\kappa_\nu$ and another modulus, so $\Lambda/\kappa_\nu$, the product of the other moduli, is coprime to $\kappa_\nu$. Let $\pi_\nu$ be an integer that inverts $\Lambda/\kappa_\nu$ modulo $\kappa_\nu$, so that $\pi_\nu\,\Lambda/\kappa_\nu\equiv 1 \pmod{\kappa_\nu}$; such an integer exists because the two numbers are coprime. Put

$$\tau=\sum_{\nu=1}^{\chi}\delta_\nu\,\pi_\nu\,\frac{\Lambda}{\kappa_\nu}.$$

Fix an index $\nu_0$ and reduce modulo $\kappa_{\nu_0}$. Every term with $\nu\ne\nu_0$ contains the factor $\kappa_{\nu_0}$ inside $\Lambda/\kappa_\nu$, so it vanishes. The term with $\nu=\nu_0$ is congruent to $\delta_{\nu_0}$, because $\pi_{\nu_0}\,\Lambda/\kappa_{\nu_0}\equiv 1$. So $\tau\equiv\delta_{\nu_0} \pmod{\kappa_{\nu_0}}$ for every $\nu_0$.

For example, take $\chi=3$, moduli $3$, $4$, $5$ (pairwise coprime, so $\Lambda=60$), and residues $2$, $3$, $1$. Then $\Lambda/3=20$, $\Lambda/4=15$ and $\Lambda/5=12$. The inverses are $\pi_1=2$, since $2\cdot 20=40\equiv 1 \pmod 3$; $\pi_2=3$, since $3\cdot 15=45\equiv 1 \pmod 4$; and $\pi_3=3$, since $3\cdot 12=36\equiv 1 \pmod 5$. So

$$\tau = 2\cdot 2\cdot 20+3\cdot 3\cdot 15+1\cdot 3\cdot 12 = 80+135+36 = 251.$$

Since $251=4\cdot 60+11$, the solutions are exactly the integers $11+60k$. Checking, $11$ leaves remainder $2$ mod $3$, remainder $3$ mod $4$, and remainder $1$ mod $5$.

The paper relies on this theorem for the same kind of split. The moduli play the role of axis lengths, and the residues of a position on each axis determine that position.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0417-audit-chinese-remainder-theorem.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0417-audit-chinese-remainder-theorem` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.
