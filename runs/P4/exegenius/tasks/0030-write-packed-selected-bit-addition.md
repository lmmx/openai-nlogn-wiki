# exegenius task 0030-write-packed-selected-bit-addition

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle
Gloss: One fixed multitape procedure XORs the selected bit (offset ρ of each of f chunks of K bits) of chunk x into chunk y while restoring chunk z, in time O(V(L^τ+1)) plus negligible repair terms; this performs a binary row addition used for change of basis.

## This page in the argument

The step: One fixed multitape procedure XORs the selected bit at offset $\rho$ of each of the $f$ chunks of $K$ bits of chunk $x$ into chunk $y$ while restoring chunk $z$, in time $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ plus negligible repair terms.
How: Apply the eight packed rotations, each as a chunk interchange, a controlled shift and the undoing interchange, then repair the exceptional addresses deterministically, and finish with the top selected position by a direct two-bit XOR.
Why: A constant number of shifts of whole chunk ranges is cheap, and the places where they misbehave are an explicitly bounded set of addresses, which can be corrected without depending on the payload. (the sources say so: "addresses. The correction depends only on addresses, so the time bound is" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Eight cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges, conditioned on parities and a control bit $c$, flip the parity of $u$ when $c=1$ and restore the auxiliary integer $w$, so XORs on $f$ selected bit positions can be done at once whenever the $K$-bit segments have unused guard room. (on [Carry-free packed controlled rotations](packed-rotations.md))
- The packed rotations fail only on a set $\mathcal B$ of addresses whose guard values lie near a segment boundary, a fraction at most $80(f-1)2^{-K}$ of all addresses; extracting these records, sorting them by destination rank with a stable radix sort and reinserting them repairs the result in the worst case. (on [Deterministic repair of exceptional addresses](exceptional-address-repair.md))
- The omitted most significant selected position is handled by a two-bit XOR, and the movement costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ with all counters and cleanup included.
- The total is $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ plus the descriptor and repair terms, which vanish after division by the volume.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce multiplication to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ through radix digits, Chinese-remainder axes, Gaussian resampling and chirps, speed up the data movement and the butterfly arithmetic with two network-based tape procedures with a strict rank saving, recover the exact product by rounding and carries, and add up the costs. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures exist for fixed exponents $\tau,\lambda'<1$: one interchanges two disjoint address chunks of $u$ bits in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time, and one applies a normalized butterfly layer on up to $d$ address chunks in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time, where $V$ is the logical bit volume.; how: Obtain both from one fixed linear network that exchanges two banks of values and restores every auxiliary value, whose edge frame changes are smaller calls of the same procedure; the strict inequality $s<Wm$ on their number gives a recursion with a power saving.
- The normalized butterfly $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ can be applied at once to the same bit offset of $D\le d$ address chunks of every polynomial record in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with $\lambda'<1$, exactly up to one final truncation.; how: Write $H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_DC^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D$, compute $C^{\otimes D}$ by the recursive phase-frame layer on rows split among the wire roles, evaluate everything exactly with guard bits and truncate once at the end. (on [Simultaneous normalized butterfly layer](simultaneous-layer.md))
- To apply $C^{\otimes e}$ on $e=mf$ selected bits, group them into $m$ slots of $f$ chunks, change the binary basis by packed row additions, apply the $f$-fold forward child on each of the $s_{\rm c}$ residual-basis slots, and change back; inverse children cost no extra call because $C^{-1}=-iZCZ$.; how: Write each edge's frame change as $\mathcal P_M\bigl(\prod_j C_{e_j}^{\epsilon_j}\bigr)\mathcal P_M^{-1}$, implement the invertible matrix $M$ by elementary row additions on corresponding bits of whole slots, and recurse on the slots. (on [Recursive phase-frame layer on slots](phase-frame-layer.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (L1.3.3, L1.3.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**L1.3.3**: The omitted most significant selected position is handled by a two-bit XOR, and the movement costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ with all counters and cleanup included.
Source: "Finally apply the two-bit XOR to $x_{j_{f-1}},y_{j_{f-1}}$ by" (paper)
> Finally apply the two-bit XOR to $x_{j_{f-1}},y_{j_{f-1}}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:elementary-streams}, splitting those chunks at the selected positions and collapsing the other intervals. Its descriptor again has a fixed number of positive lengths, each at most $V$. This costs $O(V)$ and supplies the omitted selected position. When $f=1$, $S_0,T_0$ are identities, $\mathcal B$ is empty, and this last step is the entire algorithm.

**L1.3.4**: The total is $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ plus the descriptor and repair terms, which vanish after division by the volume.
Source: "The movement costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$." (paper)
> The movement costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$. A fixed number of full record scans costs $O(MA_{\rm rect}^3+V)$, and the at most $A_{\rm rect}$ radix passes cost $O(|\mathcal B|A_{\rm rect}(R+A_{\rm rect}))$; skip them when the extracted bank is empty. The initial descriptor has a fixed number of canonical integers of $O(A_{\rm rect})$ bits, so its preparation is covered by $O(MA_{\rm rect}^3)$. All counters, positioning, rewinds, and cleanup are included. Equation~\eqref{eq:packed-bad-fraction} proves \eqref{eq:packed-rectangle-time} on a fixed number of tapes. After division by $V=MR$, its additional terms are bounded by $A_{\rm rect}^3/R$ and $80(f-1)2^{-K}A_{\rm rect}(1+A_{\rm rect}/R)$. Under the stated family bounds the first tends to zero, and the second is $O(p^2 2^{-K}(1+A_{\rm rect}/R))=o(1)$. This proves the final assertion. \end{proof}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- L1.3.1 (on [Carry-free packed controlled rotations](packed-rotations.md)): Eight cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges, conditioned on parities and a control bit $c$, flip the parity of $u$ when $c=1$ and restore the auxiliary integer $w$, so XORs on $f$ selected bit positions can be done at once whenever the $K$-bit segments have unused guard room.
- L1.3.2 (on [Deterministic repair of exceptional addresses](exceptional-address-repair.md)): The packed rotations fail only on a set $\mathcal B$ of addresses whose guard values lie near a segment boundary, a fraction at most $80(f-1)2^{-K}$ of all addresses; extracting these records, sorting them by destination rank with a stable radix sort and reinserting them repairs the result in the worst case.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Carry-free packed controlled rotations](packed-rotations.md): Eight cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges, conditioned on parities and a control bit, flip the parity of u when the control is 1 and restore the auxiliary w, so that XORs on f selected bit positions can be done at once as long as the K-bit segments have unused guard room.

- [Deterministic repair of exceptional addresses](exceptional-address-repair.md): The packed rotations fail only on a set of addresses whose guard values are near the segment boundary, a fraction at most 80(f−1)2^{−K} of all addresses; these records are extracted, sorted by destination rank with stable radix sort, and reinserted, keeping the bound worst-case.

## Pages that build on this one

- Recursive phase-frame layer on slots: To apply C^{⊗e} on e = m·f selected bits, group the bits into m slots of f chunks, change binary basis by packed row additions, apply the f-fold inverse or forward child on each residual-basis slot (s_c children in total), and change back; inverses cost no extra child since C⁻¹ = −iZCZ.

Consider $R$-bit records in lexicographic order on \[ [N_0]\times[2^L]_{\chi_1}\times[N_1]\times[2^L]_{\chi_2} \times[N_2]\times[2^L]_{\chi_3}\times[N_3]. \] The subscript names the chunk at that position.

With $\delta_{\rm bad}=\min\{1,80(f-1)2^{-K}\}$, its time is \begin{equation} \label{eq:packed-rectangle-time} O\!\left(V(L^\tau+1)+MA_{\rm rect}^3+ \delta_{\rm bad}MA_{\rm rect}(R+A_{\rm rect})\right). \end{equation} When $A_{\rm rect}=O(p)$, $R$ exceeds every fixed polynomial in $p$, $f\le d\le p$, and $K/\log p\to\infty$, this is $O(V(L^\tau+1))$, uniformly over the permitted lengths and payloads in the fixed family. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0030-write-packed-selected-bit-addition.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0030-write-packed-selected-bit-addition.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0030-write-packed-selected-bit-addition` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0030-write-packed-selected-bit-addition`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
