# exegenius task 0010-write-bluestein-chirp

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/D3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Bluestein chirp identity
Gloss: Converts a Fourier transform into a cyclic convolution via chirp factors.

## This page in the argument

The step: Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, with its target permutation, into a normalized cyclic convolution; the permutation cancels.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- Two $n$-bit integers can be multiplied exactly on a fixed finite-tape machine in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce multiplication to convolution, build two fast tape procedures whose recursion has a strict rank saving, and assemble the transforms into an exact product (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The integer product is reduced to a convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, computed with the fast procedures, with exact recovery of the result.; how: chain the reductions: convolution on the ring, Gaussian resampling, chirps, Chinese-remainder axes, phase twist, then precision and cost

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Convolution and radix-digit reduction](convolution.md): Multiplying integers reduces, by splitting them into radix digits, to convolving short integer coefficient lists.

- [Discrete Fourier transform](fourier-transform.md): Evaluating a coefficient list at roots of unity, turning convolution into pointwise product; computed in levels of two-point butterflies.
  Shown as: Bluestein chirp identity *<predicate>* Discrete Fourier transform

## Pages that build on this one

- Coefficient twist to the polynomial ring: A phase twist turns the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo y^r+1 whose negative wrap yields the cyclic wrap after untwisting.
- Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time: Deterministic fixed-tape multiplication of n-bit integers in O(n(lg n)^{1−κ}), κ=2^{-182}, disproving the n log n conjecture in this model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform," (paper)

  > Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution. A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$; its negative wrap gives precisely the original cyclic wrap after the twist is removed. Sections~\ref{sec:synthetic-layouts} and~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products} compute convolution on the remaining axes over this polynomial ring. The two forward synthetic transforms retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes that order. Their polynomial products use signed packing and the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine.

- "\begin{lemma}[Chirp and permutation cancellation]" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Chirp and permutation cancellation] \label{lem:chirp-permutation} With $R,Q,s_i,t_i$ as in Lemma~\ref{lem:tensor-resampling}, assume every $t_i$ is even. For $\boldsymbol j\in\mathbb Z^d$, define \[ a_{\boldsymbol j} =\exp\left(-\pi i\sum_{i=1}^d\frac{s_i j_i^2}{t_i}\right). \] Then $a$ has period $t_i$ in coordinate $i$, and \begin{equation} QF_{\boldsymbol t}u =\overline a\mathbin{\cdot} \frac{a*(\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}u)}{T}. \label{eq:permuted-chirp} \end{equation} If $S=\prod_i s_i$, then \begin{equation} (RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+) \bigl[(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot} (RF_{\boldsymbol s}v)\bigr] =\frac{u*v}{S^2}. \label{eq:source-permutation-cancel} \end{equation} Complex conjugation of the input and output of an algorithm for $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ gives an algorithm for $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$. \end{lemma}

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-bluestein-chirp.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-bluestein-chirp.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0010-write-bluestein-chirp` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-bluestein-chirp`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them.
