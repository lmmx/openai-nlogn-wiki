# exegenius task 0078-write-crt-address-map

Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e4/B2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Chinese-remainder address map to distinct prime axes
Gloss: An algebra isomorphism x ↦ Π x_i^{μ_i} turning one cyclic convolution of length S = Π s_i (pairwise coprime) into a d-dimensional cyclic convolution on prime axes, implemented as triangular controlled shifts plus axis reordering and zero padding.
Also called: Agarwal–Cooley map, Φ

## This page in the argument

The step: The map $\Phi:x\mapsto\prod_i x_i^{\mu_i}$ turns cyclic convolution of length $S$ into $d$-dimensional cyclic convolution on pairwise coprime axes, implemented by triangular controlled shifts.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, using fast address interchange, fast simultaneous butterfly layers, and the resampling, chirp and synthetic-convolution reduction.; how: supply the two fast tape procedures, then insert them into a reduction from the integer product to polynomial-ring convolution, and add up every cost (on [Power-saving integer multiplication theorem](main-theorem.md))
- Radix-$2^b$ digit convolution on $S$ distinct prime axes, computed by transform, pointwise product and opposite transform at precision $p$ in a padded box of $T$ entries, gives the exact $2n$-bit product after scaling, rounding and carries.; how: reduce the integer product to a cyclic convolution of radix digits, move it to prime axes by a CRT map, replace each prime-length transform by power-of-two transforms through Gaussian resampling and a chirp, and solve the remaining ring convolution by synthetic transforms (on [The multiplication algorithm: digits to transform, pointwise product and back](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Multidimensional transform on a tensor of axes](multidimensional-transform.md): The tensor product F_{q₁}⊗…⊗F_{q_d} of one-dimensional Fourier transforms over d axes, computed one axis (line) at a time, with multidimensional cyclic convolution handled the same way.
  Shown as: Chinese-remainder address map to distinct prime axes *<predicate>* Multidimensional transform on a tensor of axes
- [Integer multiplication as convolution of radix digits](multiplication-by-convolution.md): Write each operand as a polynomial in 2^b with radix-2^b digit coefficients; the product coefficients are a convolution of digit lists (each below 2³ᵇ), padded so cyclic convolution has no wraparound, and carries recover the integer product.
  Shown as: Chinese-remainder address map to distinct prime axes *<predicate>* Integer multiplication as convolution of radix digits
- [Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings](controlled-cyclic-shifts.md): Updating a target address field y ↦ y + a(controls) mod q^b, where the controls precede the target on tape, by splitting each fiber into two pieces and merging in swapped order in linear time; also multiplication by fixed rational units mod q^b.
  Shown as: Chinese-remainder address map to distinct prime axes *<predicate>* Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings

## Pages that build on this one

- Parameter choice: precision, dimension, axis lengths and prime source lengths: For input length n, take b = ⌈log₂ n⌉, precision p = 6b, dimension d = ⌊b^ε⌋, chunk K = ⌊d^c⌋, power-of-two axis lengths t_i ∈ {r/2, r} with product T ≈ n/b, and distinct odd primes s_i just below t_i with T/2 < S < T so all resampling hypotheses hold.
- The multiplication algorithm: digits to transform, pointwise product and back: Convert operands to digit lists on a padded prime-axis box via Φ, apply the source transform (resample, chirp convolution through the twist, resample) to each, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, scale by S and 2^{2b+4}, undo Φ, round and propagate carries.

- "theorem to convert one cyclic convolution into multidimensional cyclic" (paper)

  > To use the source tensor, we first place the ordinary coefficient stream in its tensor order. Agarwal and Cooley used the Chinese remainder theorem to convert one cyclic convolution into multidimensional cyclic convolution~\cite{AgarwalCooley1977}. The following map uses that algebraic split, with coordinate powers that make the change of order a sequence of controlled cyclic shifts.

- "b_i=a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j\pmod{s_i}" (paper)

  > Every ordinary coefficient index has a unique mixed-radix expression \[ k=\sum_{j=1}^d a_jP_j,\qquad 0\le a_j<s_j. \] The coordinate of $\Phi(x^k)$ in axis $i$ is \begin{equation}\label{eq:triangular-crt} b_i=a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j\pmod{s_i}. \end{equation} Indeed terms with $j>i$ are divisible by $s_i$, and $\mu_iP_i=1$ modulo $s_i$. Numerical order of $k$ is lexicographic order of $(a_d,\ldots,a_1)$. Insert the padding in one nested scan of the full box $\prod_i[0,t_i)$ in this lexicographic order, with $a_d$ the outermost counter and $a_1$ the innermost. At an address satisfying $a_i<s_i$ for every $i$, copy the next original coefficient record; at every other address, write a zero record. The valid addresses occur in the original coefficient order, so each record is copied to its intended mixed-radix address. To delete the padding after the inverse axis reorder, use the same enumeration, copying the record at each valid address and skipping the record at each invalid address.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0078-write-crt-address-map.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0078-write-crt-address-map.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0078-write-crt-address-map` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0078-write-crt-address-map`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
