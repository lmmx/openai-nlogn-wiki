Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F1B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: The multiplication algorithm
Gloss: Splits both inputs into digits, applies the coefficient-address map, computes the source transform of each, multiplies pointwise, applies the opposite-sign transform with scalings, rounds and propagates carries.

## This page in the argument

The step: Two $n$-bit integers are multiplied exactly by splitting them into radix-$2^b$ digits, mapping the digit convolution onto prime axes, computing source transforms of both, multiplying pointwise, applying the opposite-sign transform with scalings, then rounding and propagating carries.
How: reduce integer product to digit convolution, evaluate the convolution through the source transforms, and recover exact integers from approximations
Why: Exactness comes from rounding approximate coefficients that are known to be integers, so every approximation error must be shown to be below $1/2$. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Each input is written as a polynomial in $2^b$ with digit coefficients, and with enough zero padding the cyclic convolution modulo $x^S-1$ equals the ordinary product, whose coefficients are below $2^{3b}$. (on [Integer multiplication as digit convolution](int-as-convolution.md))
- Distinct odd primes $s_i$ just below the powers of two $t_i$ are found by deterministic search so that $T/2<S<T$ and every hypothesis of the resampling lemma holds. (on [Choice of prime source lengths](prime-lengths.md))
- The Chinese-remainder map $x\mapsto\prod_i x_i^{\mu_i}$ is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution, and on tape it is a triangular sequence of prefix-controlled cyclic shifts plus axis exchanges. (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-axis-map.md))
- Normalized cyclic convolution $f*g/T$ of complex arrays on power-of-two axes is obtained by twisting the last axis into the polynomial ring and using the ring convolution. (on [Complex cyclic convolution by coefficient twist](complex-convolution.md))
- The middle factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ is evaluated by the chirp identity as phase multiplication, complex convolution with the chirp array, and phase multiplication.
- The source transform applies the Gaussian map $\mathcal A$ line by line, the chirp transform, the map $\mathcal B_0$, and an exact scale by $2^\gamma$, and has exact counterpart $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$. (on [Source transform procedure](source-transform.md))
- The source transforms of both digit arrays are computed.
- The two transforms are multiplied pointwise exactly and truncated to $p$ fractional bits.
- The opposite-sign transform is applied and the result is scaled exactly by $S$ and then by $2^{2b+4}S$, so that by permutation cancellation the exact counterpart is the integer coefficient convolution.
- The recovered coefficient error is below $1/2$, so rounding gives the integer convolution coefficients, and radix-$2^b$ carries yield exactly $2n$ product bits. (on [Rounding and carry propagation to the exact product](exact-recovery.md))

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- There is one deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine multiplying $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: build two fast tape procedures from linear networks with a rank saving, insert them into a Gaussian-resampling and chirp reduction of the digit convolution to a ring convolution, and balance all parameters (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (D.5, D.7, D.8, D.9). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**D.5**: The middle factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ is evaluated by the chirp identity as phase multiplication, complex convolution with the chirp array, and phase multiplication.
Source: "We next use the complex convolution to evaluate the middle factor" (paper)
> We next use the complex convolution to evaluate the middle factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ in \eqref{eq:no-sort-tensor}, and then compose it with the Gaussian maps. For the chirp array $a$ in \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp}, the phase numerator at tensor address $j$ is computed modulo $2r$ as \[ -\sum_i s_i j_i^2(r/t_i)\pmod{2r}. \] All integers have $O(p)$ bits and $r/t_i\in\{1,2\}$. Scan the stored axis descriptors and compute the $d$ squares and products with the previously established integer multiplier. Additions, reductions modulo a power of two, and restarting local counters cost $O(p)$ per term; multiplication costs $O(p\log p)=O(p^{1+\delta})$. Exponential evaluation then has the same $O(p^{1+\delta})$ bound. Thus chirp construction costs $O(Td p^{1+\delta})$ in total. In particular, this cost includes the scan of the axis descriptors at every coefficient.

**D.7**: The source transforms of both digit arrays are computed.

> With these streams prepared, perform the following operations. \begin{enumerate} \item Apply the coefficient-address map $\Phi$, with its padded layout, to obtain source arrays $u,v$. Their coefficients are exact $p$-bit grid values of norm less than $1/4$. \item Compute $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(u)$ and $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(v)$. \item Multiply corresponding complex coefficients exactly and truncate each real and imaginary part toward zero to $p$ fractional bits, writing the result in the common $w_{\rm c}$-bit component format. Denote the resulting source array by $z$. \item Compute $\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)$ and multiply its grid numerators exactly by $S$, retaining the denominator $2^p$ and writing each component in signed width $w_{\rm c}+b$. Denote the represented dyadic array by $\widetilde w$. \item Multiply the grid numerators of $\widetilde w$ exactly by $2^{2b+4}S$, again retaining the denominator $2^p$, and write each component in signed width $w_{\rm c}+4b+4$. Round the represented real values to

**D.8**: The two transforms are multiplied pointwise exactly and truncated to $p$ fractional bits.

Round the represented real values to the nearest integers. At each valid address, write the rounded coefficient in one signed

**D.9**: The opposite-sign transform is applied and the result is scaled exactly by $S$ and then by $2^{2b+4}S$, so that by permutation cancellation the exact counterpart is the integer coefficient convolution.

Round the represented real values to the nearest integers. At each valid address, write the rounded coefficient in one signed $(3b+1)$-bit word, most significant bit first; at every padded address, write a zero word of that width. Supply this local payload width to $\Phi^{-1}$ and apply it, including removal of the address padding, to restore the ordinary coefficien

- D.1 (on [Integer multiplication as digit convolution](int-as-convolution.md)): Each input is written as a polynomial in $2^b$ with digit coefficients, and with enough zero padding the cyclic convolution modulo $x^S-1$ equals the ordinary product, whose coefficients are below $2^{3b}$.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The source-transform procedures now supply the three transforms needed for the radix-digit convolution." (paper)

  > The source-transform procedures now supply the three transforms needed for the radix-digit convolution. Read each stored operand backward from its least significant end in groups of $b$ bits. This produces the radix-$2^b$ digits $a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}$ in increasing coefficient order. Buffer each group on a fixed work tape and read it back most significant bit first, reversing its least-significant-first input order; pad the final short group with leading zeroes. For digit $a_j$, write the exact grid numerator $a_j2^{p-b-2}$ in a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit real word, followed by a zero $w_{\rm c}$-bit imaginary word. This exponent is nonnegative because $p=6b$, and the represented value is exactly $a_j2^{-b-2}$. Append $S-q$ zero coefficient records. Buffering and ordering the groups costs $O(n)$, including the one partial group's padding, and writing the $S$ records costs $O(Sp)$. Together with the initial count and copies, this input conversion costs $O(n+Sp)=O(Tp)$; all $n$ input bits, including leading zeroes, are retained before the final group is padded.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0045-write-mult-algorithm.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0045-write-mult-algorithm.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0045-write-mult-algorithm` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0045-write-mult-algorithm`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
