# exegenius task 0161-write-hvdh-multiplier

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Established O(n log n) multiplier
Gloss: The earlier Harvey–van der Hoeven multitape algorithm multiplying N-bit integers in O(N log N) time, used here only as an ordinary subroutine.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- A single deterministic Turing machine with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture of Sch\"onhage and Strassen in this model. (on [Power-saving integer multiplication](main-result.md))
- Normalized cyclic convolution over the polynomial ring $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ on the remaining $d-1$ axes is computed from two forward synthetic transforms in retained order, $M$ pointwise polynomial products and the opposite transform, in $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$ time with error less than $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$. (on [Convolution from the retained transform layout](ring-convolution.md))
- For disk-grid polynomials $f,g\in\mathcal R_r$ the exact Gaussian-integer numerators of $fg$, and then $Q_p(fg/r)$, are computed in $O(rp\log(rp))$ time using four integer products by the established multiplier at packing base $B_0=2^{4p}$. (on [Signed packing](signed-packing.md))
- The Fourier transforms of pairwise coprime prime lengths $s_i$ that the integer product needs are computed through power-of-two lengths $t_i$ by Gaussian resampling and Bluestein chirps, with the source and target coordinate permutations left inside the transform identities, so that none is executed as a sort. (on [Retained permutation cancellation](retained-permutations.md))
- For coprime $s<t$ with $\theta=t/s-1>p/\alpha^4$ and permutations $(P_su)_j=u_{tj}$, $(P_tv)_k=v_{-sk}$ there are linear contractions $A$, $B_0$ with $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$, computed with error less than $p^2$ in time $O(tp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ without executing $P_s$ or $P_t$. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- The three ordered numerical maps $\widetilde{\mathsf S}'$, $\widetilde{\mathsf J}'$, $\widetilde{\mathsf D}'$ have errors $16p$, $3p^2/4$, $4$ and times $O(tp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$, $O(tp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$, $O(tp^{1+\delta})$.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine" (paper)

  > Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution. A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$; its negative wrap gives precisely the original cyclic wrap after the twist is removed. Sections~\ref{sec:synthetic-layouts} and~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products} compute convolution on the remaining axes over this polynomial ring. The two forward synthetic transforms retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes that order. Their polynomial products use signed packing and the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine.

- "Calls to the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier are ordinary subroutine" (paper)

  > More specifically, the proof adapts Harvey and van der Hoeven's Gaussian-resampling identity, contraction bounds, and short-convolution procedures~\cite[Theorem~4.2, Proposition~4.7 and Lemmas~4.8--4.12]{HarveyHoeven2021}. Their framework already permits arbitrary dimension. Here the source and target permutations remain in the transform identity, while the faster tape procedures perform the required axis movements. Bluestein's conversion to convolution~\cite{Bluestein1970} and the synthetic-root convolution algorithm are retained; the latter follows the polynomial-transform construction in~\cite[Section~2.4 and Section~3]{HarveyHoeven2021}. Signed coefficient packing is a form of Kronecker substitution, with the fixed-tape version of~\cite[Lemma~2.5]{HarveyHoeven2021} as a direct antecedent. Calls to the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier are ordinary subroutine calls; they do not invoke the improved theorem recursively.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- Cite or cut this step: "The multiplier is called only after" (Overstated. The page says the established multiplier is called only after the Fourier transforms are reduced to polynomial products over C[y]/(y^r+1), via signed packing into four products on O(rp) bits. The paper also calls it elsewhere, for chirp numerators: squares and products of O(p)-bit numerators, computed with the established O(N log(2N)) multiplier at a cost of O(d p^{1+delta}) per entry (paper.tex lines 4891-4895), and for the small twist and scalar pointwise products on O(p)-bit numerators (lines 4896-4898). These are not ring-product calls. The paper's own summaries say only that polynomial products use signed packing and the multiplier (lines 202-204), and that calls to the multiplier are ordinary subroutine calls (lines 328-329). The correct statement is that the ring products go through signed packing, and other integer products on O(p)-bit numerators also use the multiplier.). It is inside reasoning added for an earlier step, so do not explain it further: cite the source for it, or remove the claim.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 292 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 365 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

The established multiplier is the earlier Harvey–van der Hoeven algorithm, which multiplies two integers in $O(N\log N)$ time, where $N$ is the number of bits in each factor (this $N$ is not the bank size of the exchange network); the new algorithm calls it as an ordinary subroutine for the integer products it cannot avoid.

The multiplier runs in the [Fixed finite-tape machine model](machine-model.md), the same model as the main result, so a call costs its $O(N\log N)$ steps with no change of machine to account for. The paper takes this bound from Harvey and van der Hoeven <cite data-source="paper">We use the established $O(N\log N)$ integer multiplier of</cite>; its proof is in their paper and is not reproduced here. It is the bound that Schönhage and Strassen conjectured optimal ([Schönhage–Strassen optimality conjecture](conjecture.md)), so it is the benchmark the main result beats.

## How it is used

The multiplier is not the source of the saving. The multiplier is called only after the new algorithm reduces its [Fourier transforms](dft.md) to polynomial products over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$. [Signed packing](signed-packing.md) turns each such product into four integer products on $O(rp)$ bits, where $r$ is the record length and $p$ the number of fractional bits, and these go to the established multiplier.

## Why the calls add no recursion

The new algorithm does have recursion of its own, in its layer and address-layout recursions. The multiplier calls contribute none of it, for two reasons.

First, each call is an ordinary subroutine call on records of $O(rp)$ bits, fewer than the input, so it is not a call of the improved algorithm on a smaller input <cite data-source="paper">they do not call the improved algorithm being constructed.</cite> Hence no recurrence for the new algorithm passes through the multiplier.

Second, whatever recursion the Harvey–van der Hoeven algorithm uses internally is already paid for by its $O(N\log N)$ bound <cite data-source="paper">The internal recursion of the established integer</cite>. Its cost is therefore charged as a separate term, not folded into a recurrence <cite data-source="paper">already included in their separately charged running times.</cite>

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

```json

```

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0161-write-hvdh-multiplier.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0161-write-hvdh-multiplier.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0161-write-hvdh-multiplier` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0161-write-hvdh-multiplier`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
