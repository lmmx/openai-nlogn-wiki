# exegenius task 0005-write-convolution-dft

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/B3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Convolution and the discrete Fourier transform
Gloss: Convolution of coefficient lists is computed by transforming with roots of unity, multiplying pointwise, and transforming back.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Normalized convolution over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ is computed exactly enough from synthetic transforms and packed polynomial products. (on [Exact normalized polynomial products](exact-ring-products.md))
- The synthetic transforms $F_t^{\pm}$ over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, with $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$, satisfy $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$. (on [Synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md))
- Splitting both inputs into radix-$2^b$ digits turns the product into a convolution of short integer coefficients, followed by carries. (on [Multiplication as digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md))
- A Chinese-remainder address map places the coefficient list on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes preserving convolution. (on [Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes](crt-prime-axes.md))
- Gaussian resampling gives $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$ expressing a transform on coprime lengths through a transform with power-of-two lengths, keeping the permutations. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- Bluestein's chirp identity turns the transform with its target permutation into a cyclic convolution, and the retained source permutation cancels across forward and opposite transforms. (on [Bluestein chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md))
- The twist $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ turns cyclic convolution of length $r$ into convolution modulo $y^r+1$, whose negative wrap gives the cyclic wrap after untwisting. (on [Coefficient twist to the polynomial ring](phase-twist.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Synthetic polynomial transforms: Fourier-type transforms over the polynomial ring where powers of y serve as roots of unity, built from address rearrangements, signed shifts and two-point butterflies (Nussbaumer).
- Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes: Placing the coefficient list on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map that preserves convolution.
- Gaussian resampling: Harvey–van der Hoeven identity expressing a Fourier transform on coprime-length axes through a transform with power-of-two lengths; the coordinate permutations are retained in the identity rather than sorted.
- Bluestein chirp identity: Converts a Fourier transform (with its target permutation) into a cyclic convolution via multiplication by chirp phases; the retained source permutation cancels across forward and opposite transforms.
- Multiplication as digit convolution: Splitting the inputs into radix digits turns integer multiplication into convolution of short integer coefficients, followed by rounding and carry propagation.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "For an integer $q\geq 1$, write" (paper)

  > For an integer $q\geq 1$, write \[ (F_q u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{-2\pi i jk/q}, \qquad (F_q^+ u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{2\pi i jk/q}. \] All subscripts on a vector of length $q$ are taken modulo $q$. The vector norm is the maximum modulus of its coordinates. All operator norms are induced by this norm: $\|L\|=\sup_{\|u\|\leq1}\|Lu\|$. Each normalized Fourier transform above is a contraction, since each output averages inputs multiplied by complex numbers of modulus one. Coordinate permutations preserve the norm. For an integer precision $p\geq1$, put \[ \mathbb D_p=\{2^{-p}(a+ib):a,b\in\mathbb Z,\ a^2+b^2\leq 2^{2p}\}. \] For storage between completed scalar routines, put $w_{\rm c}=p+2$. Represent $2^{-p}(a+ib)\in\mathbb D_p$ by a

- "Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to
convolution of short integer coefficients." (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.
