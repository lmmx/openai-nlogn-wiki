# exegenius task 0005-write-ring-y-r-plus-1

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/O2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, induction, modular arithmetic, gcd, primes, the Chinese remainder theorem, binary representation and XOR), a first linear algebra course (vector spaces, matrices, rank, Gaussian elimination, eigenvalues, mostly over the reals but with arithmetic mod 2 seen in discrete math), single-variable calculus (limits, exponentials and logarithms, geometric series, simple inequalities, Newton's method), and an algorithms and theory sequence (asymptotic notation, recurrences, sorting, binary search, Turing machines and time complexity, schoolbook multiplication with carries). They have not studied fast Fourier transform based multiplication, the Schönhage–Strassen/Harvey–van der Hoeven line of work, polynomial transforms over quotient rings, tensor products, bilinear forms over finite fields, or the extremal set-theory constructions the paper borrows; those are what the wiki explains.

## This page

Concept: Polynomial ring ℂ[y]/(y^r + 1)
Gloss: The ring R_r of complex polynomials of degree below r with y^r = −1, where powers of y are 2r-th roots of unity and multiplying by them is a signed cyclic shift of the coefficient list.
Also called: R_r, synthetic roots of unity
Heading: Polynomial ring $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $\mathbb C$ (complex numbers): The field of complex numbers supplying the polynomial coefficients.
- $y$ (indeterminate): The polynomial variable, whose powers serve as roots of unity because y^r = −1.
- $r$ (record length): The number of complex coefficients in a polynomial record, a power of two.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- On the layouts used, applying $H_0$ to the same bit of up to $d$ equal-width $K$-bit address chunks, coefficientwise on polynomial records with $p$-bit grid coefficients, costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'=1-2^{-54}$ and error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$. (on [Simultaneous butterfly layer in O(V d^λ′)](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md))
- A multidimensional synthetic transform $F^-_{\boldsymbol t}$ on $M$ records of $\mathcal R_r$ with $r=2^\ell$, and its opposite transform consuming the same stored order, have error below $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}$ and cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$ where $T=rM$. (on [Synthetic transform tape layout and cost](synthetic-transform-layout.md))
- With $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$, a $H_0$ butterfly followed by a twiddle $\omega_t^{-k}$ and two half-length transforms computes $F_t^-$, leaving outputs in bit-reversed stored frequency order. (on [Synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md))
- Two disk-grid polynomials of $\mathcal R_r$ are multiplied exactly by packing their signed coefficients into integers for the $O(N\log N)$ multiplier, returning $Q_p(fg/r)$ in time $O(rp\log(rp))$. (on [Signed packing (Kronecker substitution)](signed-packing.md))
- The twist $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ with $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$ turns cyclic convolution along the last axis into multiplication in $\mathcal R_r$, and untwisting recovers the cyclic wrap with the correct sign. (on [Coefficient phase twist](coefficient-twist.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Synthetic polynomial transforms: Nussbaumer–Quandalle Fourier transforms over arrays of R_r elements using ω_t = y^{2r/t} as roots of unity, computed by radix-two decimation-in-frequency rounds of butterflies and monomial twiddles, with outputs left in bit-reversed stored frequency order.
- Coefficient phase twist: The isomorphism x_d ↦ ζy (ζ = e^{πi/r}) turning cyclic convolution along the last axis into negacyclic multiplication in ℂ[y]/(y^r+1), whose negative wrap reproduces the cyclic wrap after untwisting.
- Signed packing (Kronecker substitution): Multiplying two polynomial records of R_r by packing their signed fixed-point coefficients into large integers, calling the O(N log N) integer multiplier, and unpacking the exact product.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "one coordinate
is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two." (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

- "Multiplication
by $y^a$, for any integer $a$, permutes the coefficients and changes
some signs" (paper)

  > For an integer $r\geq 2$ that is a power of two, put \[ \mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1),\qquad \left\|\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}z_k y^k\right\|_\infty =\max_{0\leq k<r}|z_k|. \] We always use representatives of degree less than $r$. Multiplication by $y^a$, for any integer $a$, permutes the coefficients and changes some signs; consequently it is an isometry for this norm. For arrays over $\mathcal R_r$, the same notation denotes the maximum over all coefficients in all entries. A disk array has norm at most one. A $p$-bit grid array has real and imaginary coefficient parts in $2^{-p}\mathbb Z$. For any array, let $Q_p$ truncate each real and imaginary coefficient part toward zero to this grid. Then \begin{equation} \|Q_p z-z\|_\infty<\sqrt2\,2^{-p},\qquad \|Q_p z\|_\infty\leq\|z\|_\infty. \label{eq:transform-truncate} \end{equation}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0005-write-ring-y-r-plus-1.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0005-write-ring-y-r-plus-1.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0005-write-ring-y-r-plus-1` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0005-write-ring-y-r-plus-1`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
