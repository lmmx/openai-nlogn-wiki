# exegenius task 0051-write-prime-axis-lengths

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/Q2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Distinct prime axis lengths
Gloss: Choosing distinct odd primes sᵢ slightly below the power-of-two axis lengths tᵢ, so the source axes are pairwise coprime and each ratio tᵢ/sᵢ leaves room for resampling.

## This page in the argument

The step: Distinct odd primes $s_i$ with $(1-2\eta)t_i<s_i\le(1-\eta)t_i$ exist, give $T/2<S<T$, and satisfy every hypothesis of the resampling lemma for large $n$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine computes $\operatorname{bin}_{2n}(\operatorname{val}(x)\operatorname{val}(y))$ for all $n$-bit inputs in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in that model.; how: build two sub-logarithmic tape procedures (address-chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) from finite linear networks with a rank saving, insert them into the Harvey--van der Hoeven reduction of multiplication to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ via a Chinese-remainder map, Gaussian resampling, chirps and a phase twist, recover the integer coefficients exactly, and sum the normalized cost table (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md): The Harvey–van der Hoeven identity expressing a Fourier transform of prime length s through one of power-of-two length t > s, sandwiched between contractions built from Gaussian kernels, with a scale factor 2^{2α²}.
  Shown as: Distinct prime axis lengths *<predicate>* Gaussian resampling

## Pages that build on this one

- Chinese-remainder address map: The isomorphism x ↦ ∏ xᵢ^{μᵢ} from one cyclic convolution of length S = ∏ sᵢ to a multidimensional cyclic convolution on the prime axes, implemented on tape by triangular controlled shifts and axis moves.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The distinct prime lengths $s_i$ must be close to the powers of two $t_i$" (paper)

  > The distinct prime lengths $s_i$ must be close to the powers of two $t_i$: their product must occupy a fixed fraction of the padded box, while each ratio $t_i/s_i$ must leave enough separation for resampling. We verify both requirements for the parameters just chosen.

- "We may therefore choose distinct odd primes satisfying" (paper)

  > l \[ (1-2\eta)x<q\leq(1-\eta)x \] contains at least $\eta x/(2\log x)$ primes. Here $\log$ is the natural logarithm. The size bounds in \eqref{eq:sizes} give $d=\Theta(p^\epsilon)$ and $\log r=\Theta(p/d)$. For large $n$ we have $d\geq2$, so $0<\eta<1/4$, and \[ \frac{\log(r/2)}d=\Theta(p^{1-2\epsilon})\longrightarrow\infty. \] Thus both $x=r/2$ and $x=r$ satisfy $\log x>8d=2/\eta$. For either choice, the stated lower bound for the number of primes is $x/(8d\log x)$ and exceeds $d$: indeed, $\log x=\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})$, whereas $\log(8d^2\log x)=O(\log p)=o(\log x)$, so $x>8d^2\log x$ eventually. The two intervals are disjoint because $(1-\eta)r/2<(1-2\eta)r$ for $\eta<1/4$, and both intervals lie above $2$. We may therefore choose distinct odd primes satisfying \[ (1-2\eta)t_i<s_i\leq(1-\eta)t_i. \] Every $\gcd(s_i,t_i)$ equals one because $t_i$ is a power of two. Put $S=\prod_i s_i$. Multiplying the lower bounds on $s_i$ and applying strict Bernoulli inequality gives \[ \frac ST> \left(1-\frac1{2d}\right)^d>\frac12 \qquad(d\geq2). \] Together with $s_i<t_i$, this gives $T/2<S<T$. Writing $\theta_i=t_i/s_i-1$, the upper bound on $s_i$ gives $\theta_i\geq\eta/(1-\eta)>\eta$. Therefore \[ \alpha^4\theta_i>\frac{12d^2b}{4d}=3db\geq6b=p. \] The choice of $\alpha$ gives $\alpha=\Theta(p^{1/4+\epsilon/2})$, and \eqref{eq:gamma} already ensures $2\leq\alpha<\sqrt p$ for large $n$. We also have $t_i\leq r\leq T<8n/b<2^{6b}=2^p$. Thus every hypothesis of Lemma~\ref{lem:no-s

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0051-write-prime-axis-lengths.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0051-write-prime-axis-lengths.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0051-write-prime-axis-lengths` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0051-write-prime-axis-lengths`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
