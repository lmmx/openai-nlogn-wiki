Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Address-field interchange
Gloss: A tape procedure that swaps two disjoint contiguous address fields of an array in time that grows like a power of the field width, rather than linearly.
Also called: power-width interchange, tape procedure for interchanging address chunks

## This page in the argument

The step: Two disjoint contiguous address fields of $u$ bits can be interchanged in time that grows more slowly than linearly in $u$.
How: build the permutation from XOR combinations of intermediate data in a linear network
Why: A permutation of fields can be built from XOR combinations, which a linear network carries out while restoring its scratch values. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Two disjoint contiguous address fields of $u$ bits are interchanged by the first procedure.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- Exact multiplication of two $n$-bit integers runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time on one deterministic fixed-tape machine, with $\kappa = 2^{-182}$.; how: reduce exact multiplication to radix-digit convolution, compute that convolution with fast tape transforms, and check that the output is exact (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))

## Evidence from the sources

- "The first procedure interchanges two disjoint contiguous address fields of u bits in an array" (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "the result does not depend on their starting contents" (The conclusion depends on the claim that the linked network is fixed and returns the scratch values unchanged. The page does not say how the network does this, so the reader cannot check it.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The source's signed version of this schedule is Over bits the signs disappear, which gives the chain above." (The signed schedule is never given on the page, and the sentence refers to a source the reader does not have. The reader cannot check that the signs disappear or that they yield the stated chain.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The cost bound comes from a recursion on the field width" (The recursion is not stated or linked, so the reader cannot derive the O(V u^tau) bound from the page.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "This saving is what the multiplication algorithm needs, since of its transforms." (The sentence is incomplete, and the reason the algorithm needs this saving is not given, so the reader cannot check the claim.)
- "scratch values" is the concept [Scratch storage](scratch-storage.md), now a prerequisite: link it where the term is used.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 389 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 486 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

Address-field interchange is a tape procedure that swaps two disjoint contiguous address fields of an array in time that grows like a power of the field width. Field moves of this kind are the basic rearrangements of the multiplication algorithm, so the bound below prices each of them.

An address of an array is a string of bits, and an address field is a block of consecutive bits inside it. Two fields are disjoint when they share no bit. The array's addresses form a complete Cartesian product, so every combination of values of its fields occurs as an address exactly once. The procedure runs on the [Fixed-tape machine model](fixed-tape-model.md): each step reads and writes at most one cell on each tape.

Let $u$ be the number of bits in each field. Here $V$ is the number of stored bits in the array. The exponent $\tau$ is a fixed number with $\tau<1$. The interchange runs in $O(V u^{\tau})$ time. For fixed $V$ this grows like a power of $u$ with exponent below one, so it grows more slowly than linearly in $u$. <cite data-source="paper">Its cost is O(V uτ ) for a fixed τ < 1.</cite>

The method is not a direct copy of the fields. <cite data-source="paper">Our address procedure forms XOR combinations of intermediate data</cite>, even though its final effect is a permutation. Let $x$ be the first field and $y$ the second, each read as a block of bits at matching positions. Let $\oplus$ denote bitwise exclusive or (XOR). Three XOR steps swap the two fields:
$$(x,y)\to(x\oplus y,\;y)\to(x\oplus y,\;x)\to(y,\;x).$$
The first step replaces $x$ by $x\oplus y$. The second replaces $y$ by $y\oplus(x\oplus y)=x$. The third replaces $x$ by $(x\oplus y)\oplus x=y$. For example, with $x=1$ and $y=0$ the pairs are $(1,0)\to(1,0)\to(1,1)\to(0,1)$, and the last pair is the swapped pair $(y,x)$. The source's signed version of this schedule is <cite data-source="paper">Starting from (x, y), the three stages give (x, y + x), then (−y, y + x), then (−y, x).</cite> Over bits the signs disappear, which gives the chain above.

Each step is a pointwise XOR of one field into the other, applied at all matching addresses at once. The interchange is carried out by a [Linear networks and frames](linear-network-frames.md) network that restores its scratch values. The network is fixed and <cite data-source="paper">restores every auxiliary value.</cite> Because the scratch values come back unchanged, the result does not depend on their starting contents. <cite data-source="paper">The final permutation is exact for arbitrary initial auxiliary values.</cite>

The cost bound comes from a recursion on the field width, and <cite data-source="paper">the resulting recurrence saves a power of the chunk width.</cite> This saving is what the multiplication algorithm needs, since <cite data-source="paper">Fast address interchanges organize the layouts</cite> of its transforms. The main result, [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md), relies on it.
