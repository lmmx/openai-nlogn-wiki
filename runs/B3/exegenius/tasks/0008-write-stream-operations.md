# exegenius task 0008-write-stream-operations

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/B3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Elementary stream operations on tapes
Gloss: Array order, scans, controlled shifts and rational scalings that a fixed-tape machine performs in linear time.

## This page in the argument

The step: Fixed-radix digit moves, splits, merges and row splitting on an array of volume $V$ take $O(V)$ steps on a fixed number of tapes.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A fixed deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two fast tape procedures, use them in synthetic transforms for ring convolution, then chain the reductions from integer multiplication (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-result.md))
- Two tape procedures, an address interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, cost a power of their parameter below the first power times the volume.; how: build both from fixed linear networks that restore scratch values, and recurse on their rank saving

## Pages that build on this one

- Synthetic polynomial transforms: Fourier-type transforms over the polynomial ring where powers of y serve as roots of unity, built from address rearrangements, signed shifts and two-point butterflies (Nussbaumer).
- Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes: Placing the coefficient list on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map that preserves convolution.
- Linear networks, roles and frames: A fixed linear network exchanging two banks of values with signs and restoring auxiliary values; roles are wire positions and invertible frames D_v change the stored representation so intermediate frames cancel and only an endpoint operator remains.
- Address shear and triangular factorization: Fields updated by (H,D) -> (H+D,D) over a residue ring; rational matrices factor as lower-triangular times partial permutation times lower-triangular, so shears run in tape order.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "\begin{lemma}[Elementary stream operations]" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Elementary stream operations] \label{lem:elementary-streams} Fix a radix $q\ge2$. Each of the following operations on an array of volume $V$ takes $O(V)$ steps on a fixed number of one-dimensional tapes: \begin{enumerate} \item any fixed permutation of the pair of digit values at two specified radix-$q$ positions, whether or not the positions are adjacent; \item moving one specified radix-$q$ digit to another position, preserving the order of the intervening positions; \item splitting on a specified radix-$q$ digit, applying a fixed pointwise map to aligned streams, and merging them back; \item for positive integers $P,R,B$, within each prefix of an array on $[P]\times[R]\times[B]$, splitting whole rows cyclically into a fixed number $W$ of streams, and, when $W$ divides $R$, merging those streams in any fixed order of the row classes. \end{enumerate} The bounds include shape preparation, counter initialization and resets, and returning or clearing the visited portions of work tapes. Their constants may depend on the fixed radix, the fixed pointwise map, and the fixed number of row classes. \end{lemma}

- "\begin{lemma}[Controlled shifts and fixed rational scalings]" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Controlled shifts and fixed rational scalings] \label{lem:ordered-affine-streams} Fix a prime $q$, a fixed number of control fields, and finitely many rational coefficients whose denominators are prime to $q$. Whenever a coefficient is used as a unit, also require its numerator to be prime to $q$. Put $Q=q^b$, $b\ge1$. Suppose a target field $y\in[Q]$ follows its control fields, each control used in an offset having $O(b)$ digits. An update \[ y\longmapsto y+a(\text{controls})\pmod Q \] costs $O(V)$ if the offset can be prepared in $b^{O(1)}$ time from the fixed number of control values. In particular, this holds for a fixed rational linear combination of them, specialized modulo $Q$. Multiplication of $y$ by any of the specified rational units, and its inverse, also costs $O(V)$. Arbitrarily long intervening spectator fields and suffix records are permitted. \end{lemma}
