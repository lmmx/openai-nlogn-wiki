# exegenius task 0010-write-address-shear

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/D1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

## This page

Concept: Address shear and triangular factorization
Gloss: The endpoint operator (H,D) -> (H+D,D) on address fields, with matrix shears implemented through lower-triangular (Bruhat-type) factorization in tape order.

## This page in the argument

The step: The address shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+D,D)$ with a rational matrix is done in linear time per fixed matrix via lower-triangular (Bruhat-type) factorization in tape order.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) with power savings, use them in synthetic transforms, and place those in the reduction of multiplication to convolution (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ))](main-result.md))
- Two disjoint address fields of $u$ digits in an array of volume $V$ can be exchanged in time $O(Vu^\tau)$ with $\tau<1$, the final map being an exact permutation.; how: Build a fixed linear exchange network with a rank saving, realize its edges by address shears, and recurse on smaller interchanges (on [Fast address-field interchange costing O(V u^τ)](address-interchange.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Linear exchange networks with roles and frames](linear-network-frames.md): A fixed linear network exchanging two banks of values and restoring auxiliary values; applied to arrays via rows distributed over wire roles, with an invertible frame per gate so intermediate frames cancel.
  Shown as: Address shear and triangular factorization *<predicate>* Linear exchange networks with roles and frames
- [Address fields, streams and scans on tape](tape-layout-streams.md): Arrays stored in lexicographic address order on tape, with fields of address digits, processed by linear scans, controlled shifts and cyclic splitting into role streams.
  Shown as: Address shear and triangular factorization *<predicate>* Address fields, streams and scans on tape

## Pages that build on this one

- Fast address-field interchange costing O(V u^τ): Exchanging two disjoint address fields of u digits in an array of volume V in time O(V u^τ) with τ<1, via XOR-like combinations that end in an exact permutation.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "two fields, written as vectors $H,D$ over a common residue ring, are
updated by $(H,D)\mapsto(H+D,D)$" (paper)

  > For the bit procedure, that endpoint operator is an address shear: two fields, written as vectors $H,D$ over a common residue ring, are updated by $(H,D)\mapsto(H+D,D)$. Two further linear-cost address updates complete their interchange. For the numerical procedure, the endpoint operator becomes the simultaneous $H_0$ layer after diagonal phase operations and a dyadic scale. The intermediate frames are chosen so that every edge can be implemented by smaller calls to the same procedure.

- "Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Lower triangular factorization] \label{lem:lower-lower} Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization \[ A=E_1\Pi E_2, \] where $E_1,E_2$ are invertible lower triangular rational matrices and $\Pi$ has exactly $a$ entries equal to one, with at most one in each row and column, and all remaining entries zero. \end{lemma}

- "(H,D)\longmapsto(H+AD,D)" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[The cost of a rational matrix shear] \label{lem:matrix-shear} Let $\mathcal A$ be a fixed finite collection of rational $m\times m$ matrices. There is a fixed odd prime $q$ such that the following holds. Let $H=(H_1,\ldots,H_m)$ and $D=(D_1,\ldots,D_m)$ be two ordered groups of fields, every field ranging over $[q^b]$, with every $H_i$ before every $D_j$. For $A\in\mathcal A$ of rational rank $a$, the permutation \[ (H,D)\longmapsto(H+AD,D) \quad\text{over }\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z \] can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work. Every interchange is between an $H$ field and a $D$ field. Spectators between any of the formal fields are allowed. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-address-shear.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-address-shear.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0010-write-address-shear` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-address-shear`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them.
