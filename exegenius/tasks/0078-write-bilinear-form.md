# exegenius task 0078-write-bilinear-form

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

## This page

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "A label is a nondegenerate subspace of a fixed bilinear" (paper)

  > The scalar network already has the required signed exchange. We now choose its intermediate labels to make the changes of frame inexpensive. A label is a nondegenerate subspace of a fixed bilinear space. On every edge one label will contain the other. For such an edge, the orthogonal residual is 13

- "A nondegenerate symmetric bilinear space is nonalternating precisely when" (paper)

  > P ⊗ F ⊗ Q. The table includes the interstage edges through in, and the initial and final data labels match their terminals, so no other dimension changes occur. The signed sum of dimension changes telescopes at every gate: each touched wire has one incoming and one outgoing incidence with the same gate label. The sum of source dimensions is N , while the sum of sink dimensions is W m − N . The signed increase is therefore W m − 2N . There are Ic decreasing edges, each of loss h; replacing signed changes by absolute changes adds 2L. Now work over F2 . A nondegenerate symmetric bilinear space is nonalternating precisely when it contains a vector of norm one. The lines P, Q have such vectors. If B = ̸ 0, a coordinate unit outside the support of the earlier tensor vector belongs to B: that support has size 3j−1 < hj−1 when j > 1. The same argument gives a unit vector in Q⊥ when it is nonzero. A triple complement, and the complement of two neighboring triple lines, contain coordinate units outside supports of sizes at most three and six, respectively. Full tensor spaces contain coordinate units as well. In each nonzero tensor summand, tensoring these chosen norm-one vectors gives a norm-one vector; placing it in that orthogonal summand gives one in the whole residual. Each residual is nondegenerate by the decompositions
