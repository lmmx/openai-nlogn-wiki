# exegenius task 0124-audit-phase-twist

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file and the paper at `sources/paper.tex`: do not read other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Fidelity: also check that the page's mathematics is right, and report what is wrong even where this reader could follow it. For each claim that states a definition, a hypothesis, a step of a proof, a value or a conclusion, work out what it assumes and what it concludes, and check it against everything this task file gives: the page's definitions, its other claims and its quotations. Report as a `step` any claim that is false, inconsistent with another statement on the page, stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it, or missing a hypothesis it needs. Quote the claim, and say in the note what is wrong and what the correct statement is.

The source: the paper this page explains is at `sources/paper.tex` (LaTeX). For each such claim, also find the passage of the paper that states, defines or proves it (search the file for the claim's terms and symbols, then read the passage around each match) and compare: every hypothesis present, the same scope and quantifiers, the same constants, signs, exponents and inequality directions, a conclusion no stronger than the paper's, and the right result, lemma or author credited. Report any mismatch as a `step` in the same way, and give the paper's line number in the note.

What counts as an error: report a claim as wrong only if, as this page states it, it is false; inconsistent with the page; stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it; missing a hypothesis without which it is false; given a wrong value, sign, exponent, constant, quantifier or credit; or presented as following from something it does not follow from. Do not report a correct statement as wrong because it is informal, abbreviated or simplified, uses a word in the paper's own sense, or leaves a technical precondition to another page or to the paper. If the paper's own summary of the same step states it the same way, it is not an error.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Phase twist

The phase twist is a diagonal change of basis that turns the last cyclic axis of a complex array into the coordinate of a negacyclic polynomial ring, so that cyclic convolution can be computed by ring convolution, and that is undone afterwards.

Let $f$ and $g$ be two complex arrays with $d$ axes, the last of length $r$, and $T$ entries in all. Convolution along the last axis is multiplication in $\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)$, where $x_d$ is the variable of that axis. The twist converts the last cyclic axis into the coordinate of the [Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1](ring-y.md), written $\mathcal R_r$, where $y^r=-1$ instead.

## The map

Let $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$, so $\zeta^r=-1$. Define the ring map $\Theta$ from $\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)$ to $\mathcal R_r$ by $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$. It is well defined because $(\zeta y)^r=(-1)(-1)=1$.

Here $k$ and $l$ index coefficients, not operations. Since $\Theta(x_d^k)=\zeta^k y^k$, $\Theta$ is diagonal on the bases $(x_d^k)$ and $(y^k)$, multiplying coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k\ne0$. It is therefore an isomorphism, with inverse multiplying by $\zeta^{-k}$. Both maps preserve the coefficient sup norm, since $|\zeta^{\pm k}|=1$ (cited)

## The wrap

Take $k,l<r$ and write $k+l=j+hr$, with $j<r$ the resulting position and $h\in\{0,1\}$ the wrap indicator. After twisting, the term carries $\zeta^{k+l}$, and negacyclic reduction contributes $(-1)^h$, so the factor is
$$\zeta^{k+l}(-1)^h=\zeta^j(\zeta^r)^h(-1)^h=\zeta^j.$$
The coefficient of $y^j$ is thus $\zeta^j$ times the cyclic coefficient; untwisting by $\zeta^{-j}$ restores it with the correct sign. The twist reproduces [Cyclic convolution](convolution.md) on that axis.

For $r=2$, $\zeta=i$. Twisting $(f_0,f_1)$ and $(g_0,g_1)$ gives $(f_0,if_1)$ and $(g_0,ig_1)$. Their product has $f_0g_0+f_1g_1$ and $i(f_0g_1+f_1g_0)$. Multiplying the second by $\zeta^{-1}=-i$ gives the cyclic result.

## Whole arrays

Then $M=T/r$ is the number of lines along the last axis, and $\iota$ reads each line $(f_{\boldsymbol j,k})_k$ as the polynomial $\sum_k f_{\boldsymbol j,k}y^k$, giving an array of $M$ records in $\mathcal R_r$. Let $(D_\pm f)_{\boldsymbol j,k}=\zeta^{\pm k}f_{\boldsymbol j,k}$ multiply entry $k$ of each line by $\zeta^{\pm k}$. Then $\iota D_+$ applies $\Theta$ to every line, with inverse $D_-\iota^{-1}$.

Let $\mathcal M_r$ be the ring convolution of [Convolution from the retained transform layout](ring-convolution.md): it convolves the first $d-1$ axes over $\mathcal R_r$, dividing by $T$. The composite $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}$, the normalized complex cyclic convolution, is
$$\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=\frac{f*g}{T}.$$
Here $*$ is cyclic convolution over all $d$ axes.

## Contraction

Write $\|f\|$ for the sup norm of an array $f$: the largest modulus of a scalar coefficient. A bilinear map is a bilinear contraction if its value has norm at most the product of the norms of its arguments ([Contractions and bilinear contractions](contraction-maps.md)). $\mathcal M_r$ is one: a fixed output coefficient averages $rM$ signed scalar products of coefficients, each at most $\|f\|\|g\|$ in modulus, so $\|\mathcal M_r(f,g)\|\le\|f\|\|g\|$ (cited).

The maps $\iota^{\pm1}$ only regroup scalars, and $D_\pm$ multiplies by numbers of modulus $1$, so all are linear and keep the sup norm. Hence
$$\|\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)\|=\|\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)\|\le\|\iota D_+f\|\,\|\iota D_+g\|=\|f\|\,\|g\|,$$
so $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}$, a bilinear map composed with linear ones, is a bilinear contraction.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0124-audit-phase-twist.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0124-audit-phase-twist` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0124-audit-phase-twist`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
