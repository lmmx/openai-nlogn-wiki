# exegenius task 0259-write-ring-homomorphism

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Ring homomorphism and isomorphism
Gloss: A map between rings that preserves addition and multiplication; it is an isomorphism when it is also bijective, so that the two rings have the same structure.
Also called: ring homomorphism and ring isomorphism

## Where the argument relies on this page

- A phase twist turns the last cyclic coordinate into a coordinate of the polynomial ring modulo $y^r + 1$. (on [Phase twist](phase-twist.md))
- Convolution on the remaining axes over the polynomial ring is computed by two forward synthetic transforms, a pointwise product, an opposite transform, and packed integer products. (on [Convolution over the polynomial ring](polynomial-ring-convolution.md))

## Evidence from the sources

- "Hence Φ is an isomorphism and preserves cyclic" (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "The paper uses this same check for its map $\Phi$ from a cyclic quotient ring into a multivariate quotient ring:" (The sentence ends with a colon, and the text that follows is an example in Q and Q', not a statement about Phi. The map and its check are never given, so the reader cannot follow the claim.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The paper's map $\Phi$ sends a generator to a monomial whose powers cover the target basis, so it is bijective as well as a homomorphism:" (The target basis is never identified, so the reader cannot check that the powers of the monomial cover it, or that the map is a homomorphism at all.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The paper concludes that convolution." (Incomplete sentence. The conclusion is missing, so the reader cannot tell what is concluded.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "A map out of $Q$ is determined by the image of $w$" (This holds only if the map fixes complex scalars. The page requires only phi(1)=1 and never says that complex scalars are preserved, so the reader cannot check the claim.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "It also preserves products." (Only one product, (1+w) squared, is checked. The page does not give the general argument, so the reader cannot check that the map preserves all products.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "sends the basis $1,w$ of $Q$ to the basis $1,\sqrt{-1}\,y$ of $Q'$" (The page never shows that 1 and sqrt(-1) y form a basis of Q' (that each element of Q' has a unique form), nor that 1 and w form a basis of Q, so the reader cannot check the bijectivity conclusion.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "This is a ring homomorphism, because $\psi(w)=1$ satisfies $w^2=1$." (The page gives only the well-definedness condition, and only as a necessary condition. It checks no products for psi, so the reader cannot verify that psi preserves both operations.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Every element of $Q$ has the form $\lambda+\mu w$ with $\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb{C}$" (The page does not say how a quotient ring element is reduced using w^2=1, nor that the coefficients are unique. The reader does not know quotient rings, so the claim cannot be checked.)
- Say what $\xi$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "$\varphi(\xi\eta)=\varphi(\xi)\varphi(\eta)$ for all $\xi,\eta\in Q$"
- Say what $\eta$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "$\varphi(\xi\eta)=\varphi(\xi)\varphi(\eta)$ for all $\xi,\eta\in Q$"
- Say what $w$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "the ring in which the indeterminate $w$ satisfies $w^2=1$"
- Explain "multivariate quotient ring" inline: its concept depends on this page, so it cannot be a prerequisite.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 443 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 553 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

A ring homomorphism is a map $\varphi: Q \to Q'$ between two rings that preserves both operations, so that $\varphi(\xi+\eta)=\varphi(\xi)+\varphi(\eta)$ and $\varphi(\xi\eta)=\varphi(\xi)\varphi(\eta)$ for all $\xi,\eta\in Q$, and $\varphi(1)=1$. Ring homomorphisms carry a convolution from one ring to another without changing its values, which is how the paper moves convolution on the remaining axes into a polynomial ring where it can be computed.

A ring is a set with addition, subtraction, a zero, and an associative multiplication with identity $1$ that distributes over addition. A ring homomorphism is an isomorphism when it is also bijective (one-to-one and onto). Then $Q$ and $Q'$ have the same structure, and each sum or product in one ring corresponds to exactly one in the other: the inverse map also preserves both operations, so a product computed in $Q'$ maps back to the product in $Q$.

**Checking that a map is a homomorphism.** Let $Q=\mathbb{C}[w]/(w^2-1)$, the ring in which the indeterminate $w$ satisfies $w^2=1$. Every element of $Q$ has the form $\lambda+\mu w$ with $\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb{C}$, where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are its coefficients. A map out of $Q$ is determined by the image of $w$, and it is well defined only if that image satisfies the relation $w^2=1$. A ring homomorphism into the quotient ring [Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1](polynomial-ring-mod-yr-plus-1.md) is checked in that ring by substituting $y^r=-1$. The paper uses this same check for its map $\Phi$ from a cyclic quotient ring into a multivariate quotient ring: <cite data-source="paper">respects xS = 1, so it defines an algebra map.</cite>

**Example.** Let $Q'=\mathbb{C}[y]/(y^2+1)$, where $y^2=-1$, and define $\varphi: Q \to Q'$ by $\varphi(\lambda+\mu w)=\lambda+\mu\sqrt{-1}\,y$. The image of $w$ is $\sqrt{-1}\,y$, and $(\sqrt{-1}\,y)^2=-y^2=1$ in $Q'$, so the relation $w^2=1$ is respected and $\varphi$ is well defined. It also preserves products. In $Q$, $(1+w)^2=2+2w$, while in $Q'$
$$(1+\sqrt{-1}\,y)^2=1+2\sqrt{-1}\,y+(\sqrt{-1}\,y)^2=2+2\sqrt{-1}\,y=\varphi(2+2w).$$
The map is bijective because it is $\mathbb{C}$-linear and sends the basis $1,w$ of $Q$ to the basis $1,\sqrt{-1}\,y$ of $Q'$. Its inverse sends $1+y$ to $1-\sqrt{-1}\,w$, since $\varphi(1-\sqrt{-1}\,w)=1-\sqrt{-1}\cdot\sqrt{-1}\,y=1+y$. So $\varphi$ is an isomorphism.

**A map that is not an isomorphism.** Let $\psi: Q \to \mathbb{C}$ be $\psi(\lambda+\mu w)=\lambda+\mu$. This is a ring homomorphism, because $\psi(w)=1$ satisfies $w^2=1$. It is not bijective: $w-1$ is nonzero in $Q$ but $\psi(w-1)=0$. So $Q$ and $\mathbb{C}$ do not have the same structure, and the values of $\psi$ do not determine the element of $Q$ they came from.

**Why the paper needs it.** The paper's map $\Phi$ sends a generator to a monomial whose powers cover the target basis, so it is bijective as well as a homomorphism: <cite data-source="paper">through all target basis monomials exactly once.</cite> The paper concludes that <cite data-source="paper">Hence Φ is an isomorphism and preserves cyclic</cite> convolution. An isomorphism of this kind [preserves cyclic convolution](cyclic-convolution.md): the convolution of two sequences in one ring maps to the convolution of their images in the other.
