# exegenius task 0017-write-bit-network

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P5` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is an undergraduate computer scientist: comfortable with asymptotic notation, recurrences and divide-and-conquer, binary and two's-complement arithmetic, integer division with remainder, modular arithmetic, primes and coprimality, sets, bijections and functions, basic vector and matrix algebra, polynomials and complex numbers (including roots of unity), and basic multitape Turing machines with linear scans. The reader has seen schoolbook and Karatsuba multiplication and probably an introductory FFT in an algorithms course, but has not studied abstract algebra (rings, groups, tensor products), finite fields beyond bit arithmetic, numerical analysis of rounding, or the specialist theory of fast integer multiplication, so the wiki must explain those.

## This page

Concept: Bit network and its shear interface
Gloss: The F₂ network with W_b wires and rational labels whose endpoint matrices differ by the identity on every input role, giving the address shear H←H+D with s_b<W_b·m.

## This page in the argument

The step: The bit network on $W$ wires sends every input role to its partner with endpoint matrices differing by $I_m$, and its rank sum $s=Wm-N+2L$ is below $Wm$, giving the address shear $H\leftarrow H+D$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two tape procedures that save a power of the width, use them inside the Harvey and van der Hoeven Gaussian-resampling multiplication with polynomial transforms and retained permutations, then choose parameters, prove exactness and sum the costs (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures, an address-chunk interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, each cost a power $u^\tau$ or $d^{\lambda'}$ below the naive factor.; how: derive both procedures from fixed linear networks whose rank deficit $s<Wm$ gives a recursion that saves a power
- A fixed linear network exchanging two banks of values and restoring all scratch wires, with nested subspace labels on its gates and terminals, makes the total rank $s$ of edge changes strictly smaller than $Wm$.; how: build the scalar exchange network, make the stored arrays carry frames that commute with its pointwise gates, and choose labels from triple indicator vectors so the dimension changes can be counted

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Subspace labels and the rank saving s<Wm](subspace-labels.md): Nested nondegenerate subspaces of an m-dimensional space attached to gates and terminals so the total rank of edge changes satisfies s<Wm.
  Shown as: Bit network and its shear interface *<predicate>* Subspace labels and the rank saving s<Wm

## Pages that build on this one

- Address shear costing rank-many interchanges: The permutation (H,D)↦(H+AD,D) of address fields mod q^b is done with exactly rank(A) field interchanges plus linear work, using triangular factors and controlled shifts.
- Address-chunk interchange in O(Vu^τ) time: Exchanging two disjoint contiguous u-bit address fields of an array of volume V by XOR combinations of intermediate data, in time O(V u^τ) for a fixed τ<1; the final effect is an exact permutation.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The bit network has $W_{\rm b}$ wires, uses only pointwise XOR gates," (paper)

  > \begin{proposition}\label{prop:bit-motif-interface} The bit network has $W_{\rm b}$ wires, uses only pointwise XOR gates, and sends its input vector to the permutation $\rho$ of that vector. Its rational matrices are common to all incidences of a gate and obey \[ M_{\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))}-M_{\mathrm{source}(w)}=I_m \quad\text{for every input role }w. \] The sum of the rational ranks of all edge differences is \begin{align} s_{\rm b} &=\sum_{e}\operatorname{rank}_{\mathbb Q} (M_{\mathrm{head}(e)}-M_{\mathrm{tail}(e)})\\ &=W_{\rm b}m-N+2L_{\rm b} =177176569088785861287000000<W_{\rm b}m. \end{align} \end{proposition}

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-bit-network.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-bit-network.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0017-write-bit-network` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-bit-network`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
