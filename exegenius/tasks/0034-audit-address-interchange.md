# exegenius task 0034-audit-address-interchange

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

A term, symbol or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term, symbol or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- symbol: notation used without being defined on the page.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Address-field interchange

An address permutation moves each entry of an array from one address to another. Here the arrays are stored as streams of bits, and an address is implicit in an entry's position in the stream. Swapping two fields of an address means exchanging the positions of two groups of address digits, while keeping every other field fixed.

The procedure in this paper handles the case where the two fields are disjoint, contiguous, and each has $u$ bits, inside an array with a complete Cartesian product of addresses. For a fixed array of logical volume $V$ (the number of stored data bits), the procedure runs in $O(V u^{\tau})$ steps for a fixed exponent $\tau < 1$, and it works for arbitrary $u$.

The name "interchange" describes the effect. Take an address written as $(p, h, g, d, z)$ with $h$ and $d$ fields of width $u$. The procedure produces the address $(p, d, g, h, z)$, which swaps the two $u$-bit fields.

The procedure is not a simple sequence of digit moves. Its intermediate steps form pointwise XOR combinations of data, so during the computation the tapes hold sums of entries rather than copies of them. The final effect is still an exact permutation, and the result is exact for any initial contents of the auxiliary wires used as scratch space. The paper's [linear network](linear-network-frames.md) construction is what makes this possible.

The cost exponent $\tau$ matters because the transform layout needs many such swaps. A procedure that costs $O(V u^{\tau})$ with $\tau < 1$ is sublinear in the field width, and the saving compounds over the levels of the recursion, as explained in the [rank saving](rank-saving-recursion.md) page.
