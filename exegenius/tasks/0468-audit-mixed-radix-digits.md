# exegenius task 0468-audit-mixed-radix-digits

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Mixed-radix digits

Mixed-radix digits are the place-value digits of an integer in a positional system where each place has its own length, so the digit at each place ranges over that place's length rather than over one common base. The [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md) uses these digits to give each coefficient position a coordinate on each axis.

Fix a positive integer $\beta$, the number of places, and positive integers $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_\beta$. The place index $j$ runs from $1$ to $\beta$ and names a place. Here $\lambda_j$ is the length of place $j$, the number of values the digit at place $j$ can take. Several letters on this page have other meanings on earlier pages; here each has only the meaning given in its definition.

Let $\Lambda = \lambda_1\lambda_2\cdots\lambda_\beta$ be the product of the lengths, the number of distinct digit strings the system can write. The place value of place $j$ is $w_j = \lambda_1\lambda_2\cdots\lambda_{j-1}$, the product of the lengths of the places below it, with $w_1 = 1$.

Let $\nu$ be an integer with $0 \le \nu < \Lambda$, the integer being written. The digit $e_j$ at place $j$ is an integer with $0 \le e_j < \lambda_j$, the digit of the expansion at that place. A mixed-radix expansion of $\nu$ is a tuple $(e_1, \dots, e_\beta)$, an ordered list of digits, such that

$$\nu = \sum_{j=1}^{\beta} e_j\, w_j.$$

Every such $\nu$ has exactly one mixed-radix expansion. Here $i$ is a place index that runs over the places below $j$. Uniqueness of the expansion is based on the [Telescoping identity](telescoping-identity.md), which gives $\sum_{i<j}(\lambda_i-1)w_i = w_j - 1$ for every place $j$, since $(\lambda_i-1)w_i = w_{i+1}-w_i$.

Suppose two expansions $(e_1,\dots,e_\beta)$ and $(e'_1,\dots,e'_\beta)$ of the same $\nu$ differ, where $e'_j$ is the digit at place $j$ of the second expansion, and let $j$ be the largest place where their digits differ. Each digit at place $i$ lies in $[0,\lambda_i)$, so $|e_i-e'_i| \le \lambda_i-1$. The digits agree above $j$, so the difference of the two values is $\sum_{i\le j}(e_i-e'_i)w_i$. Its term at $j$ has absolute value at least $w_j$, while the places below $j$ contribute at most $\sum_{i<j}(\lambda_i-1)w_i = w_j-1$. The difference is therefore at least $1$ in absolute value, which contradicts both expansions giving $\nu$. Distinct digit tuples give distinct values.

The largest value a tuple gives is obtained by taking $e_j = \lambda_j-1$ at every place, which gives $\sum_j(\lambda_j-1)w_j = w_{\beta+1}-w_1 = \Lambda-1$ by the same identity, since $w_{\beta+1} = \lambda_1\cdots\lambda_\beta = \Lambda$. There are $\Lambda$ digit tuples, and they give $\Lambda$ distinct values in $\{0,\dots,\Lambda-1\}$. So every $\nu$ in that range is reached by exactly one tuple.

For example, take $\beta = 2$, $\lambda_1 = 3$ and $\lambda_2 = 4$. Then $\Lambda = 12$, $w_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = 3$. For $\nu = 7$, the digits are $e_1 = 1$ and $e_2 = 2$, since $1\cdot 1 + 2\cdot 3 = 7$. For $\nu = 11$, the digits are $e_1 = 2$ and $e_2 = 3$, since $2 + 3\cdot 3 = 11$. When every length is $2$ this is the binary expansion, and when every length is $b$ it is the base-$b$ expansion.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0468-audit-mixed-radix-digits.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0468-audit-mixed-radix-digits` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.
