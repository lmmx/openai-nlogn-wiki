# exegenius task 0407-audit-carry-propagation

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Carry propagation

Carry propagation is the final arithmetic step that turns a list of integer coefficients into the binary digits of their value. It gives the output of [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md) its exact binary form.

Carry propagation takes its input from [Radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md), whose output is the list of integer coefficients $c_0, c_1, \dots$ of the product of the two digit polynomials.

Carry propagation takes its digit width $b = \lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ from the [base-2 logarithm](base-two-logarithm.md) of $n$, the bit length of the inputs. Carry propagation computes its digit count by the [ceiling function](ceiling-function.md): $m = \lceil n/b \rceil$ is the number of digits in each input. The radix is $Q_0 = 2^b$, the number of values a digit can take, which is the base in which each digit is written. The paper uses this choice for large $n$: so that $Q_0 \ge n$. The index $t$ runs over the positions $0, 1, \dots$ of the list of coefficients, so $\sum_t c_t Q_0^t$ is the product.

Each $c_t$ is a sum of at most $m$ products of two digits, each at most $(Q_0-1)^2$, so $0 \le c_t \le m(Q_0-1)^2$. Since $m \le n \le Q_0$, this is below $Q_0^3$, as the paper also states:.

Carry propagation rewrites the same sum with digits. The digit $d_t$ is the $t$th base-$Q_0$ digit of the output, so $0 \le d_t < Q_0$. The carry $e_t$ is the amount carried into position $t$ from the lower positions. Set $e_0 = 0$ and, for $t \ge 0$,

$$d_t = (c_t + e_t) \bmod Q_0, \qquad e_{t+1} = \left\lfloor \frac{c_t + e_t}{Q_0} \right\rfloor,$$

where $w \bmod Q_0$ is the remainder of $w$ on division by $Q_0$, and $\lfloor w \rfloor$ is the largest integer not above $w$. Division with remainder gives, at every position,

$$c_t + e_t = d_t + Q_0\, e_{t+1}.$$

Why this keeps the value: in the identity below, $\tau$ counts the low positions already processed, so the sums run over $t < \tau$. For every $\tau \ge 0$,

$$\sum_{t<\tau} c_t Q_0^t = \sum_{t<\tau} d_t Q_0^t + e_\tau Q_0^\tau.$$

The identity says that the processed coefficients have the same value as the processed digits plus the carry $e_\tau$, which is still owed to the higher positions. It holds at $\tau = 0$, where both sides are $0$. If it holds at $\tau$, add $c_\tau Q_0^\tau$ to the left side. Multiplying $c_\tau + e_\tau = d_\tau + Q_0 e_{\tau+1}$ by $Q_0^\tau$ gives $c_\tau Q_0^\tau + e_\tau Q_0^\tau = d_\tau Q_0^\tau + e_{\tau+1} Q_0^{\tau+1}$, so the left side becomes $\sum_{t<\tau+1} d_t Q_0^t + e_{\tau+1} Q_0^{\tau+1}$, which is the identity at $\tau+1$.

The recurrence reads $c_t$ only after $e_t$ is known, and $e_t$ depends on all lower coefficients, so the positions must be processed from $t = 0$ upward.

The carries stay small. If $0 \le e_t \le m(Q_0-1)$, then $c_t + e_t \le m(Q_0-1)^2 + m(Q_0-1) = mQ_0(Q_0-1)$, so $e_{t+1} \le m(Q_0-1)$. Since $e_0 = 0$, every carry obeys this bound.. Since $m \le Q_0$, the bound is below $Q_0^2$, so each carry fits in $2b$ bits.

Coefficients vanish past the end. The product of two polynomials of degree $m-1$ has degree at most $2m-2$, so $c_t = 0$ for $t \ge 2m-1$, and there $e_{t+1} = \lfloor e_t / Q_0 \rfloor$. The carry $e_{2m-1}$ is below $Q_0^2$, so $e_{2m} \le Q_0 - 1$ and $e_{2m+1} = 0$. The leftover carry is written out the same way, one digit at a time:. Its digits are $d_t = e_t \bmod Q_0$ for $t = 2m-1, 2m$, and $d_t = 0$ beyond. Taking $\tau = 2m+1$ in the identity, where every $c_t$ with $t \ge 2m+1$ is zero and $e_{2m+1} = 0$, gives $\sum_t c_t Q_0^t = \sum_t d_t Q_0^t$. Each $d_t$ is a $b$-bit block, so the product is the binary string formed by writing $d_{2m}, \dots, d_0$ from the top down, each in $b$ bits.

For $Q_0 = 4$ (so $b = 2$) and three coefficients $(c_0, c_1, c_2) = (5, 3, 7)$:

- $t=0$: $c_0 + e_0 = 5$, so $d_0 = 1$ and $e_1 = 1$.
- $t=1$: $c_1 + e_1 = 4$, so $d_1 = 0$ and $e_2 = 1$.
- $t=2$: $c_2 + e_2 = 8$, so $d_2 = 0$ and $e_3 = 2$.
- The leftover carry $e_3 = 2 < 4$ gives $d_3 = 2$ and $e_4 = 0$.

The digits $(d_3, d_2, d_1, d_0) = (2, 0, 0, 1)$ give $2 \cdot 64 + 0 \cdot 16 + 0 \cdot 4 + 1 = 129 = 5 + 3 \cdot 4 + 7 \cdot 16$. In binary, each digit takes two bits: $10\,00\,00\,01$.
