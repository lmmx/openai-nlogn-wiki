# exegenius task 0017-write-packed-selected-bit-addition

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Packed selected-bit addition
Gloss: Adding corresponding selected bits of two address chunks using a third temporary chunk, via cyclic whole-chunk shifts plus a deterministic correction of an explicit small set of exceptional addresses.

## This page in the argument

The step: Under the stated growth of the parameters, the selected-bit additions $y_{j_i}\leftarrow y_{j_i}\oplus x_{j_i}$ at positions $j_i=\rho+i K$, $0\le i<f$, of two chunks of $L=f K$ bits can be performed, with a third chunk lent as temporary and restored, in time $O(V(L^\tau+1))$.
How: Perform all additions at once as eight cyclic shifts of whole chunks by offsets read from control bits, which agree with the intended XORs except at addresses whose guard values lie within 20 of the segment boundary, a small explicit set, then repair exactly that set by extracting its records, sorting them by destination rank and reinserting them.
Why: A cyclic shift of a whole chunk costs linear time, and when the guard bits keep segments from carrying into each other it performs all the bit additions in parallel; only addresses with extreme guard values can fail. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- For a Boolean control $c$ and arbitrary integers $u,w$, eight conditional additions in the displayed order flip the parity of $u$ exactly when $c=1$ and restore the auxiliary integer $w$.
- The guard values fail the interval test only for a fraction $\delta_{\rm bad}\le80(f-1)2^{-K}$ of the addresses, and outside that set the packed shifts agree with the ideal XORs.
- The exceptional addresses are extracted, given destination ranks, stably sorted by radix passes and reinserted, which implements the exact permutation everywhere in worst-case time.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution over a polynomial ring computed by Fourier-type transforms; supply the two fast tape procedures that remove the logarithmic factor from address movement and from butterfly arithmetic, both obtained from linear networks that save a power; then assemble the algorithm and tally every cost. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The map $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ applied at one common bit offset in each of $D\le d$ equal-width $K$-bit address chunks of an array of records, each a polynomial with $r$ complex coefficients on the grid $2^{-p}\mathbb Z[i]$, of total volume $V$, with a single final truncation, costs $O(V d^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$.; how: Rewrite $H_0^{\otimes D}$ as phase-diagonal conjugates of $C^{\otimes D}$, compute $C^{\otimes e}$ on $e=mf$ selected bits with the complex network (each of the $s<W m$ calls acts on $f$ bits, and the binary changes of basis are packed selected-bit additions), unroll the resulting recurrence, and bound the exact intermediate dyadics so that one truncation suffices.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S3.4.1, S3.4.2, S3.4.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S3.4.1**: For a Boolean control $c$ and arbitrary integers $u,w$, eight conditional additions in the displayed order flip the parity of $u$ exactly when $c=1$ and restore the auxiliary integer $w$.
Source: "For a Boolean control $c$ and arbitrary integers $u,w$, perform the following" (paper)
> \begin{proof} We first construct eight rotations that have the required effect away from a small set of addresses. We then correct exactly that set. For a Boolean control $c$ and arbitrary integers $u,w$, perform the following eight operations in the displayed chronological order. Every predicate uses the current values of the integers. \begin{equation} \label{eq:eight-packed-additions} \begin{array}{rcl@{\qquad}l} u&\leftarrow&u-c[\,w\equiv0\pmod2\,],&(1)\\ w&\leftarrow&w-c[\,u\equiv0\pmod2\,],&(2)\\ u&\leftarrow&u+c[\,w\equiv0\pmod2\,],&(3)\\ w&\leftarrow&w+c[\,u\equiv0\pmod2\,],&(4)\\ w&\leftarrow&w+c[\,u\equiv1\pmod2\,],&(5)\\ u&\leftarrow&u+c[\,w\equiv1\pmod2\,],&(6)\\ w&\leftarrow&w-c[\,u\equiv1\pmod2\,],&(7)\\ u&\leftarrow&u-c[\,w\equiv1\pmod2\,].&(8) \end{array} \end{equation} If $c=0$, these operations do nothing. If $c=1$, the first four operations induce the cycle $(00\ 01\ 10)$ in every square \[ \{2a,2a+1\}\ti

**S3.4.2**: The guard values fail the interval test only for a fraction $\delta_{\rm bad}\le80(f-1)2^{-K}$ of the addresses, and outside that set the packed shifts agree with the ideal XORs.
Source: "There are exactly twenty excluded values for each guard in" (paper)
> There are exactly twenty excluded values for each guard in \eqref{eq:packed-guard-interval}. Since its complete range has $2^{K-1}$ values, the union bound over the $2(f-1)$ guards gives \begin{equation} \label{eq:packed-bad-fraction} |\mathcal B|\le\delta_{\rm bad}M. \end{equation} Indeed, the complete $y,z$ ranges give the same guard distribution at each choice of spectator coordinates. No record value enters this count.

**S3.4.3**: The exceptional addresses are extracted, given destination ranks, stably sorted by radix passes and reinserted, which implements the exact permutation everywhere in worst-case time.
Source: "To implement the correction, scan the stream with a record-rank counter." (paper)
> To implement the correction, scan the stream with a record-rank counter. All chunk names are back in their original positions. Dividing the current rank through the fixed seven field lengths recovers the three chunk values and their mixed-radix record strides. The strides exclude the $R$ payload bits. All involved integers have $O(A_{\rm rect})$ bits, so schoolbook arithmetic, descriptor copying, and resets take at most $O(A_{\rm rect}^3)$ per record. Test membership in $\mathcal B$ and extract just those records. For a current exceptional address $q$, compute $q'=T_0(S_0^{-1}(q))$ by reversing the eight modular additions with negated offsets, then applying the selected XORs directly. Each reversed mask uses the current controls of that reversed line. There are at most $f\le L\le A_{\rm rect}$ selected positions, so this calculation also fits $O(A_{\rm rect}^3)$ time.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "We implement a binary row addition on corresponding selected bits in two" (paper)

  > We implement a binary row addition on corresponding selected bits in two address chunks. A third chunk supplies temporary address bits; its arbitrary initial value must be restored. The construction first uses a constant number of cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges, then corrects an explicitly bounded set of addresses. The correction depends only on addresses, so the time bound is worst-case over all payloads.

- "Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle] \label{lem:packed-selected-bit-rectangle} Let $R\ge1$, $K\ge6$, $f\ge1$, $L=fK$, and $0\le\rho<K$. Let $N_0,N_1,N_2,N_3$ be positive integers, and let $(\chi_1,\chi_2,\chi_3)$ be a permutation of $(x,y,z)$. Consider $R$-bit records in lexicographic order on \[ [N_0]\times[2^L]_{\chi_1}\times[N_1]\times[2^L]_{\chi_2} \times[N_2]\times[2^L]_{\chi_3}\times[N_3]. \] The subscript names the chunk at that position. The input supplies $N_0,\ldots,N_3,R,K,f,\rho$ as a fixed number of canonical binary integers, together with the finite permutation of the chunk names, as in Section~\ref{sec:streams}. Put \[ M=2^{3L}\prod_{h=0}^3N_h,\qquad V=MR,\qquad A_{\rm rect}=\lceil\log_2(2V)\rceil. \] At the selected positions $j_i=\

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-packed-selected-bit-addition.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-packed-selected-bit-addition.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0017-write-packed-selected-bit-addition` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-packed-selected-bit-addition`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
