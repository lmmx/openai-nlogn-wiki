# exegenius task 0016-write-dft

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/D2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Discrete Fourier transform
Gloss: The normalized transform (F_q u)_k = (1/q) Σ_j u_j e^{-2πi jk/q}; a contraction in the max norm.
Also called: Fourier transform
Heading: Normalized discrete Fourier transform $F_q$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $F_q$ (transform): The normalized Fourier transform acting on vectors of length q.
- $q$ (transform length): The number of coordinates of the vector being transformed.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- The synthetic Fourier transform over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ is a contraction with exact inverse pair up to a factor and is computed on a tape layout with simultaneous butterfly layers. (on [Synthetic polynomial transform](synthetic-transform.md))
- The Fourier transforms of coprime lengths needed for the product are expressed through power-of-two tensor transforms with the source and target permutations left inside the transform and cancelling. (on [Resampling with the permutations left in the transform](retained-permutations.md))
- A Fourier transform of length $s$ coprime to $t$ equals $2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$ up to a permutation, with contractions $A,B_0$ computable in $O(tp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- The permuted middle transform $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ equals a chirp multiplication, a cyclic convolution and another chirp, and the retained source permutation $R$ cancels across the transforms. (on [Chirp identity and permutation cancellation](bluestein-chirp.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Two-point butterfly H₀: The map H0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u−v)/2), the basic step of radix-2 fast transforms; a transform has about log n levels of butterfly layers.
- Synthetic polynomial transform: A Fourier transform over the ring R_r using ω_t = y^{2r/t} as root of unity, so twiddle multiplications are signed shifts; its inverse pairs are exact up to a factor.
- Cyclic convolution: Convolution of arrays on a product of cyclic groups; the transform turns it into a pointwise product, so convolutions are computed by transform, multiply, inverse transform.
- Chirp identity and permutation cancellation: Bluestein's identity rewrites the permuted transform Q F_t as a chirp multiplication, a cyclic convolution, and another chirp; the retained source permutation R cancels across two forward and one inverse transform.
- Gaussian resampling: The Harvey–van der Hoeven identity expressing a Fourier transform of coprime (prime) length s through one of power-of-two length t via contractions A and B0, at cost O(t p^{3/2+δ} α) per line.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "(F_q u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{-2\pi i jk/q}" (paper)

  > For an integer $q\geq 1$, write \[ (F_q u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{-2\pi i jk/q}, \qquad (F_q^+ u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{2\pi i jk/q}. \] All subscripts on a vector of length $q$ are taken modulo $q$. The vector norm is the maximum modulus of its coordinates. All operator norms are induced by this norm: $\|L\|=\sup_{\|u\|\leq1}\|Lu\|$. Each normalized Fourier transform above is a contraction, since each output averages inputs multiplied by complex numbers of modulus one. Coordinate permutations preserve the norm. For an integer precision $p\geq1$, put \[ \mathbb D_p=\{2^{-p}(a+ib):a,b\in\mathbb Z,\ a^2+b^2\leq 2^{2p}\}. \] For storage between completed scalar routines, put $w_{\rm c}=p+2$. Represent $2^{-p}(a+ib)\in\mathbb D_p$ by a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit two's-complement word fo

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-dft.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-dft.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0016-write-dft` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-dft`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them.
