# exegenius task 0033-audit-convolution-reduction

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science degree: big-O notation and worst-case time of Turing machines, polynomials and complex numbers, and the calculus the degree requires (limits, convergence of sequences and series, basic integrals). The same degree is taken to include introductory discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes, induction, sets, graphs, recurrences) and a first course in linear algebra over the reals (vectors, subspaces, matrices, elimination, dot products), each at introductory depth. Fields in the abstract sense, tensor products, bilinear forms over general fields, Gaussian integers and the Chinese remainder theorem are not assumed.

# Multiplication as convolution of digits

"Multiplication as convolution of digits" is the reduction that turns the product of two integers into a convolution of their digit sequences, followed by a carry back to binary. It is the first step of the argument: it replaces an integer product by a convolution of short coefficients, which the transform machinery can then compute.

Let $b$ be the number of bits in one digit. Let $m$ be the number of digits in each input. Let $u$ be the first input and $v$ the second. The digit sequence of $u$ is its radix-$2^b$ digits, least significant first, so $u$ has $m$ digits, each between $0$ and $2^b-1$. The digit sequence of $v$ is defined the same way.

Multiplication reduces to [Cyclic convolution](cyclic-convolution.md) of short integer coefficients, once the digit sequences are padded with zeros to length at least $2m-1$, which keeps the cyclic wrap-around from mixing terms. The paper opens with this reduction. (cited)

For example, in radix $4$ (so $b=2$), $u=13$ has digits $(1,3)$ and $v=11$ has digits $(3,2)$, since $13=1+3\cdot 4$ and $11=3+2\cdot 4$. Their convolution has coefficients $(3,11,6)$: the coefficient of $4^0$ is $1\cdot 3$, that of $4^1$ is $1\cdot 2+3\cdot 3$, and that of $4^2$ is $3\cdot 2$. The coefficient $11$ is larger than a digit, so the result is not yet in binary. Carrying is evaluating the coefficient list at $4$: $3+11\cdot 4+6\cdot 16=143=13\cdot 11$.

The point of short coefficients is size. Each coefficient is a sum of at most $m$ products of $b$-bit digits, so it fits in about $2b+\lg m$ bits, whatever the length of the inputs. The transform layers therefore work on records of fixed width rather than on whole $n$-bit integers, and the carry is done once at the end.
