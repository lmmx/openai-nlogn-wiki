# exegenius task 0197-audit-multidim-transform

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file and the paper at `sources/paper.tex`: do not read other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Fidelity: also check that the page's mathematics is right, and report what is wrong even where this reader could follow it. For each claim that states a definition, a hypothesis, a step of a proof, a value or a conclusion, work out what it assumes and what it concludes, and check it against everything this task file gives: the page's definitions, its other claims and its quotations. Report as a `step` any claim that is false, inconsistent with another statement on the page, stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it, or missing a hypothesis it needs. Quote the claim, and say in the note what is wrong and what the correct statement is.

The source: the paper this page explains is at `sources/paper.tex` (LaTeX). For each such claim, also find the passage of the paper that states, defines or proves it (search the file for the claim's terms and symbols, then read the passage around each match) and compare: every hypothesis present, the same scope and quantifiers, the same constants, signs, exponents and inequality directions, a conclusion no stronger than the paper's, and the right result, lemma or author credited. Report any mismatch as a `step` in the same way, and give the paper's line number in the note.

What counts as an error: report a claim as wrong only if, as this page states it, it is false; inconsistent with the page; stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it; missing a hypothesis without which it is false; given a wrong value, sign, exponent, constant, quantifier or credit; or presented as following from something it does not follow from. Do not report a correct statement as wrong because it is informal, abbreviated or simplified, uses a word in the paper's own sense, or leaves a technical precondition to another page or to the paper. If the paper's own summary of the same step states it the same way, it is not an error.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is a computer science undergraduate: they have taken discrete mathematics, an algorithms course (asymptotics, divide and conquer, schoolbook and Karatsuba multiplication, sorting), a first linear algebra course (vector spaces, subspaces, dimension, rank, matrices as linear maps, inverses, triangular matrices, orthogonality, bilinear forms at a basic level), calculus, elementary number theory (primes, gcd, modular arithmetic) and basic machine-level binary representation (XOR, two's complement). They have seen Turing machines with tapes only at an introductory level. They have not been taught the discrete Fourier transform or FFT as such, abstract algebra beyond basic definitions (quotient rings, finite fields as a theory), tensor products, numerical error analysis, or the specific literature on fast integer multiplication.

# Multidimensional transforms

A multidimensional transform is the Fourier transform of an array with several coordinates, computed along one axis at a time. The argument replaces the long Fourier transforms of the integer product by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two (cited).

Let $d$ be the number of axes, $i$ an axis index with $1\le i\le d$, and $q_i$ the number of positions along axis $i$, so $\boldsymbol q=(q_1,\dots,q_d)$. An entry of the array $u$ has an index tuple $j=(j_1,\dots,j_d)$ with $0\le j_i<q_i$. A line along axis $i$ is the $q_i$ entries obtained by fixing all other coordinates. For operators $G_i$ on sequences of length $q_i$, the tensor product $\bigotimes_i G_i$ applies each $G_i$ to every line along axis $i$. Here $F_{q_i}$ is the one-dimensional normalized [Discrete Fourier transform](dft.md) of length $q_i$, and $F_{\boldsymbol q}:=\bigotimes_iF_{q_i}$ (cited) is the tensor product of these. With $k$ an output index tuple shaped like $j$,
$$(F_{\boldsymbol q}u)_k=\frac1{\prod_i q_i}\sum_j u_j\,e^{-2\pi i\sum_i j_ik_i/q_i}.$$

## Cost for power-of-two axes

Write $t_i$ for the axis lengths when each is a power of two, and $T=\prod_it_i$. Each line transform is computed by the [Butterflies and the fast transform](butterfly.md) in $O(t_i\log t_i)$ operations. Axis $i$ has $T/t_i$ lines, so its pass costs $O(T\log t_i)$ and all passes $O(T\log T)$. This bound needs power-of-two lengths, so it does not apply directly to the prime lengths $s_i$ of the integer product; the identity below supplies power-of-two transforms instead.

## Lifting the resampling identity

The one-dimensional lemma of [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md) treats coprime $s_i<t_i$, with $t_i$ a power of two sufficiently larger than $s_i$. Let $p$ be the number of fractional bits of the stored values, $\alpha$ an integer resampling parameter with $2\le\alpha<\sqrt p$, and $\delta$ a fixed constant with $0<\delta<1/8$ that sets the slack in the exponent $3/2+\delta$ of $p$ in the time bound. Let $P_{s_i}$ and $P_{t_i}$ be the index permutations of the source and padded axes, and $A_i$ and $B_{0,i}$ the linear input and output maps of axis $i$. The lemma gives
$$P_{s_i}F_{s_i}=2^{2\alpha^2}B_{0,i}P_{t_i}F_{t_i}A_i.$$
Both are contractions, so an input error stays bounded, as in [Contractions and bilinear contractions](contraction-maps.md). Fixed-point algorithms approximate each with error less than $p^2$ in time $O(t_ip^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$.

Tensor the $d$ identities, with the same $p,\alpha,\delta$ on every axis. Operators compose axis by axis, so $(\bigotimes_i X_i)(\bigotimes_i Y_i)=\bigotimes_i X_iY_i$ for operators $X_i,Y_i$ on axis $i$, and the scalars multiply. Let $\boldsymbol s=(s_1,\dots,s_d)$ and $\boldsymbol t=(t_1,\dots,t_d)$ be the source and padded axis lengths, $\gamma=2d\alpha^2$ the total exponent of the scalar, and, with $R$ here not the scalar ring, $R=\bigotimes_iP_{s_i}$, $Q=\bigotimes_iP_{t_i}$, $\mathcal A=\bigotimes_iA_i$, $\mathcal B_0=\bigotimes_iB_{0,i}$:
$$RF_{\boldsymbol s}=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A.$$

A pass applies a line map to every line, so its norm is a maximum over lines; hence $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B_0$ are contractions (cited). A pass has error the maximum of the line errors, less than $p^2$, and earlier errors do not grow in later passes, so the $d$ passes give error less than $dp^2$ (cited). Summing over $T/t_i$ lines per axis, the line algorithms take $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0197-audit-multidim-transform.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0197-audit-multidim-transform` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0197-audit-multidim-transform`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
