# exegenius task 0019-audit-exact-integer-multiplication

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source, which the reader can consult: it is followable by reference, so do not report it as a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: This reader has an undergraduate computer science degree: discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, gcd and primes, binomial counting, induction), linear algebra over the reals and small fields (subspaces, rank, elimination, eigenvalues, dot-product orthogonal complements and projections), and algorithms (divide-and-conquer recurrences, Karatsuba multiplication, and the DFT and cyclic convolution as used for FFT-based polynomial multiplication). Complex numbers are known as far as roots of unity and Gaussian integers, Turing machines are known with multiple tapes, and basic probability reaches the union bound. Tensor products, bilinear forms beyond the dot product, quotient rings and the sources' network and address constructions are not part of this background.

# Exact integer multiplication

Exact integer multiplication is the problem of computing the complete product of two equal-length binary inputs, as a binary string of twice that length, with no rounding and no reduction modulo anything. Every upper bound in the argument bounds the running time of a machine that solves this problem, so this page fixes what that machine must output.

Let $x$ and $y$ be binary strings of length $n$, the number of bits in each input. For a binary string $z$, let $\mathrm{val}(z)$ be its nonnegative integer value, with the leftmost bit most significant. For a length $k$ and an integer $m$ with $0 \le m < 2^k$, let $\mathrm{bin}_k(m)$ be the binary representation of $m$, padded on the left with zeros to length $k$.

The required output is $\mathrm{bin}_{2n}(\mathrm{val}(x)\,\mathrm{val}(y))$. Each factor is below $2^n$, so the product is below $2^{2n}$ and its binary form fits in $2n$ bits. For example, with $n=2$, the strings $x=10$ and $y=11$ have values $2$ and $3$, and the output is $\mathrm{bin}_4(6)=0110$.

The input is written as $x\#y$, where $\#$ is a separator symbol placed between the two inputs; it marks where $x$ ends and $y$ begins, and it is not a bit. A multiplier is a deterministic Turing machine that, on input $x\#y$, halts with the output on its tape. The cost of a multiplier is its worst-case running time as a function of $n$. The unconditional upper bound on this model is $O(n\log n)$, reached by Harvey and van der Hoeven (cited). One machine therefore serves every input length, with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed number of one-dimensional tapes (cited). The main result saves a strict power of the logarithmic factor in this same fixed finite-tape model.
