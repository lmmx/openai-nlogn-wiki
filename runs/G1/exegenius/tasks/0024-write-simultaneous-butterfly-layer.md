# exegenius task 0024-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

## This page

Concept: Simultaneous butterfly layer
Gloss: The second tape procedure: applies H_0(u,v) = ((u+v)/2,(u−v)/2) to one selected bit in each of up to d address chunks at once on polynomial records, in time O(V d^λ') for fixed λ' < 1, evaluated exactly and truncated once.
Also called: parallel butterfly layer

## This page in the argument

The step: The layer $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ applied to one selected bit in each of up to $d$ address chunks of polynomial records takes $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time for a fixed $\lambda'<1$.
How: express a tensor product of the kernel $C$ through phase frames of the complex network, realize its binary basis changes by packed selected-bit additions on whole chunks, bound the exact dyadic values and convert to the normalized layer
Why: The source contrasts the single simultaneous layer with the $D$ separate whole-array passes that individual butterfly factors would need. (the sources say so: "factors would require $D$ whole-array passes." (paper))
Striking feature: One layer on up to $d$ axes costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$, less than the $d$ separate whole-array passes; the page should explain why the same rank saving applies to the numerical network. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Over Gaussian dyadic values the phase frame changes along the complex network are products of two-point kernels $aI+bX_v$ and telescope to $C^{\otimes m}$ on every role. (on [Phase frames and the C kernel](binary-phase-interface.md))
- Adding the same bit position of $f$ address chunks of one field into another costs a few cyclic shifts of whole chunks plus a correction of an explicitly bounded set of exceptional addresses, restoring a third chunk. (on [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md))
- The simultaneous normalized butterfly layer returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$, evaluating the whole layer exactly before one truncation.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $T_A(n)=O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce the product to a digit convolution computed by synthetic transforms, replace the address rearrangement and butterfly layers inside those transforms by two faster recursive tape procedures, then assemble, round and bound the cost (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](sub-nlogn-multiplication.md))
- Two recursive tape procedures, an address-chunk interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, run faster than the naive costs of address rearrangement and Fourier layers by a power of the width.; how: build the elementary tape tools, derive a general recursive power saving from a fixed linear network, and instantiate it twice, once for bits and once for complex values

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.5.2). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.5.2**: The simultaneous normalized butterfly layer returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$, evaluating the whole layer exactly before one truncation.
Source: "The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in the same array," (paper)
> The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in the same array, coefficient order, and component format in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time, uniformly over all these choices of $p,d,r,D,P,S,\rho,w$ and $z$. Every returned coefficient belongs to the complex unit disk, and, in the maximum coefficient norm, \[ \|Q_p(\mathcal H z)-\mathcal H z\|_\infty <\sqrt2\,2^{-p}. \] The procedure evaluates the entire layer exactly before this final truncation. Put \[ C_0=128m\bigl(s_{\rm c}+64(W_{\rm c}+m+1)^3\bigr)^2, \] where $m,W_{\rm c},s_{\rm c}$ are the fixed constants of Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface}. The procedure uses at most $p+\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil$ fractional bits and $\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil+3$ integer and sign bits per real component internally; these widths are $O(p)$. The time includes address changes, deterministic repair, row padding and its removal, and fixed-tape workspace cleanup. Its tape count is fixed, and its time constant is independent of the allowed array lengths and coefficient values. \end{proposition}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S1.5.0 (on [Phase frames and the C kernel](binary-phase-interface.md)): Over Gaussian dyadic values the phase frame changes along the complex network are products of two-point kernels $aI+bX_v$ and telescope to $C^{\otimes m}$ on every role.
- S1.5.1 (on [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md)): Adding the same bit position of $f$ address chunks of one field into another costs a few cyclic shifts of whole chunks plus a correction of an explicitly bounded set of exceptional addresses, restoring a third chunk.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Phase frames and the C kernel](binary-phase-interface.md): Over Gaussian dyadic values, the phase frame changes between binary subspace labels are products of two-point kernels aI + bX_v (a=(1+i)/2, b=(1−i)/2), one per orthonormal residual vector, and telescope to C^{⊗m} on every role.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Phase frames and the C kernel
- [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md): Adds (XORs) the same bit position of f address chunks of one field into another, using a few cyclic shifts of whole chunks and a correction of an explicitly bounded set of exceptional addresses.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Packed selected-bit addition
- [Address-chunk interchange](address-interchange.md): The first tape procedure: it swaps two disjoint address chunks of u bits in a complete array of volume V in time O(V u^τ) for a fixed τ < 1, internally using XOR combinations of intermediate data yet ending as an exact permutation.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Address-chunk interchange
- [FFT butterflies (decimation in frequency)](fft-butterfly.md): The recursive FFT step that pairs entries z_k and z_{k+t/2}, replaces them by their half-sum and half-difference, multiplies one output by a root of unity and recurses on both halves.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* FFT butterflies (decimation in frequency)
- [Fixed-point and Gaussian dyadic arithmetic](fixed-point-arithmetic.md): Complex values stored as signed two's-complement integers times 2^{−p}; additions, halvings and multiplications by i are exact with enough guard bits, and truncation Q_p to the grid has error below √2·2^{−p}.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Fixed-point and Gaussian dyadic arithmetic
- [Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1](negacyclic-ring.md): The ring of complex polynomials of degree below r in which y^r = −1, so multiplying by a power of y shifts the coefficient list with sign changes.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1
- [Recursive power saving](recursive-power-saving.md): A call at parameter m·f uses s calls at parameter f on streams of volume V/W, so cost per volume obeys F_k ≤ (s/W)F_{k−1} + O(1) with s/W < m, giving cost O(V e^τ) for some fixed τ < 1.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Recursive power saving

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays." (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0024-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
