# exegenius task 0049-write-cyclic-convolution

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Cyclic convolution and the convolution theorem
Gloss: Convolution of arrays indexed by cyclic groups; the DFT turns it into pointwise multiplication (up to normalization), so convolution can be computed by transform, pointwise product, inverse transform.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Normalized convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$ over $\mathcal R_r$ on disk-grid arrays is approximated with error below $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ in time $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$. (on [Convolution from the retained transform layout](synthetic-convolution.md))
- For the chirp $a_{\boldsymbol j}=\exp(-\pi i\sum_i s_ij_i^2/t_i)$ one has $QF_{\boldsymbol t}u=\overline a\cdot\bigl(a*(\overline a\cdot u)\bigr)/T$, so the middle transform with its frequency permutation is a normalized cyclic convolution between two phase products. (on [Bluestein chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md))
- The retained source permutation $R$ cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite-sign transform: $(RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+)\bigl[(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\cdot(RF_{\boldsymbol s}v)\bigr]=(u*v)/S^2$. (on [Cancellation of the source permutation](source-permutation-cancel.md))
- With pairwise coprime $s_i$ the map $x\mapsto\prod_i x_i^{\mu_i}$, $\mu_i=P_i^{-1}\bmod s_i$, is an isomorphism from cyclic convolution of length $S=\prod_i s_i$ to multidimensional cyclic convolution on the prime axes, implemented by triangular controlled shifts on padded axes in $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$. (on [Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes](crt-address-map.md))
- The isomorphism $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ with $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$ sends cyclic convolution of length $r$ to the ring modulo $y^r+1$ by multiplying coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k$; the negative wrap cancels the factor $\zeta^r$, so untwisting recovers the cyclic result. (on [Coefficient twist from cyclic to negacyclic](coefficient-twist.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Discrete Fourier transform](dft.md): The normalized transform (F_q u)_k = (1/q) Σ_j u_j e^{−2πi jk/q} on length-q vectors, together with its opposite-sign inverse-like partner F_q⁺.
  Shown as: Cyclic convolution and the convolution theorem *<predicate>* Discrete Fourier transform
- [Multidimensional transform and cyclic convolution on a product of axes](multidim-dft.md): The tensor product of one-dimensional DFTs along several axes of a box of coordinates, acting on arrays indexed by a product of cyclic groups.
  Shown as: Cyclic convolution and the convolution theorem *<predicate>* Multidimensional transform and cyclic convolution on a product of axes

## Pages that build on this one

- Integer multiplication as convolution of radix digits: Writing each integer as a polynomial in a radix 2^b with small digits, the product's digit coefficients are the (non-wrapping) convolution of the digit lists, followed by carry propagation.
- Bluestein chirp identity: A DFT (here with a frequency permutation) equals pre-multiplication by a chirp phase, a cyclic convolution with the chirp, and post-multiplication by the conjugate chirp, so the middle transform becomes a normalized cyclic convolution.
- Cancellation of the source permutation: The permutation R retained from resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite-sign transform: (R F⁺)[(R F u)·(R F v)] = (u*v)/S².
- Convolution from the retained transform layout: Normalized convolution over the polynomial ring: two forward synthetic transforms keep their layout, records are multiplied pointwise by signed packing, and the opposite transform consumes the same order; error below √2·M(3ℓ+1)2^{−p}.
- Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes: With pairwise coprime lengths s_i, the map x ↦ ∏ x_i^{μ_i} is an isomorphism from cyclic convolution of length ∏s_i to multidimensional cyclic convolution on the prime axes, implemented by triangular controlled shifts on padded axes.
- Coefficient twist from cyclic to negacyclic: The isomorphism x_d ↦ ζy with ζ = e^{πi/r} sends cyclic convolution of length r to the ring modulo y^r+1, multiplying coefficient k by ζ^k; the negative wrap exactly cancels the factor ζ^r, so untwisting recovers the cyclic result.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "cyclic convolution on the product of the coordinate groups" (paper)

  > The factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ in \eqref{eq:no-sort-tensor} can be computed from a cyclic convolution and two pointwise phase multiplications. The chirp identity below performs the frequency change in $Q$ without applying $Q$ as a separate permutation of the array. The second identity shows how the retained source permutation $R$ cancels when computing a convolution. Here $*$ denotes cyclic convolution on the product of the coordinate groups and a dot denotes coordinatewise multiplication.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0049-write-cyclic-convolution.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0049-write-cyclic-convolution.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0049-write-cyclic-convolution` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0049-write-cyclic-convolution`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
