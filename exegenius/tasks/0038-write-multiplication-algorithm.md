# exegenius task 0038-write-multiplication-algorithm

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: The multiplication algorithm
Gloss: Digits, then the CRT map, two forward transforms with resampling and chirps, a pointwise product, the opposite transform, rescaling, rounding and carry propagation yield the exact 2n-bit product.

## This page in the argument

The step: The exact $2n$-bit product of the two inputs is obtained from the radix-digit convolution by the chain: radix digits, Chinese-remainder address map to a product of prime cyclic axes, two forward source transforms (resampling and chirps), pointwise product, opposite transform, rescaling, rounding, and carry propagation, with total error below $1/2$.
How: Reduce the integer product to a cyclic convolution of $S$ short coefficients and compute it through the chain of reductions (digits, CRT address map, Gaussian resampling with chirps, twist to the polynomial ring, synthetic-transform convolution); recover exact integers because the accumulated error is below $1/2$.
Why: Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. (the sources say so: "Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Fixed rational exponents and sizes make every hypothesis of the lemmas hold: $b=\lceil\log_2n\rceil$, $p=6b$, $d=\lfloor b^\epsilon\rfloor$, $K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor$, a power of two $T\in[4n/b,8n/b)$, $r=2^{\lceil(\log_2T)/d\rceil}$, axis lengths $t_i\in\{r/2,r\}$ with $\prod t_i=T$, $t_d=r$, and distinct odd primes $s_i\in((1-2\eta)t_i,(1-\eta)t_i]$. (on [Parameter and prime-length choice](parameter-choice.md))
- Writing the two inputs in radix $2^b$ with $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ digits each, the product polynomial has degree at most $2q-2<2n/b\le T/2<S$, so convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no wraparound, and every coefficient $c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2<2^{3b}$. (on [Multiplication as radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md))
- The Chinese-remainder map $\Phi:\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\to\mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_i^{s_i}-1)$, $x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$, is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution, and it (with its inverse and padding) is implemented by triangular controlled shifts in $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ time. (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-map.md))
- With $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$ the map $\Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\to\mathcal R_r$, $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$, is an isomorphism multiplying coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k$; hence normalized complex cyclic convolution is $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=f*g/T$. (on [Phase twist](phase-twist.md))
- The computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$ and the source transform $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ (apply $\mathcal A$, the chirp transform, $\mathcal B_0$, then multiply by $2^\gamma$) have exact counterparts $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ and $\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A=RF_{\boldsymbol s}$.
- The algorithm: read radix digits, apply $\Phi$, compute the source transforms $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(u)$, $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(v)$, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, rescale by $S$ and $2^{2b+4}S$, round, undo $\Phi$ and propagate carries to output exactly $2n$ bits.
- The error on the recovered integer coefficients is below $1/2$, so rounding gives the exact integer coefficients, and carry propagation yields the exact binary product. (on [Error tracking and exact recovery](precision-recovery.md))

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic Turing machine with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture of Sch\"onhage and Strassen in this model.; how: Build two power-saving tape procedures (chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layer) from fixed finite linear networks; use them to accelerate the synthetic polynomial transforms and ring convolution; use Gaussian resampling with retained permutations and chirps to reduce the prime-length cyclic convolution of the radix-digit coefficients to those power-of-two transforms; assemble the exact product with a proof that the error is below $1/2$; and total the cost to show a power of $\log n$ is saved. (on [Power-saving integer multiplication](main-result.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S5.5, S5.6). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S5.5**: The computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$ and the source transform $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ (apply $\mathcal A$, the chirp transform, $\mathcal B_0$, then multiply by $2^\gamma$) have exact counterparts $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ and $\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A=RF_{\boldsymbol s}$.
How: Evaluate $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ by the chirp identity: pointwise phase, complex convolution with the chirp, pointwise phase; compose with the Gaussian maps and the exact scale $2^\gamma$.
- S5.5.1: The data operand after the first endpoint phase is $x_0=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)$.
  Source: "x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x),\\" (paper)
  > Let $\widetilde a$ be the resulting disk-grid array, so $\|\widetilde a-a\|_\infty<2\,2^{-p}$. For a disk-grid target tensor $x$ of norm at most $.6$, the computed chirp transform forms the arrays \[ \begin{aligned} x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x),\\ y_0&=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0),\\ \widetilde{\mathscr C}(x) &=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}y_0). \end{aligned} \] Thus $\widetilde a$ is the convolution kernel and $x_0$ is the data operand after the first endpoint phase. Replacing the approximations by exact phases and exact convolution gives $\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}\mathcal M_{\mathbb C} (a,\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}x)=QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$ by \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp}. Below we show that $\|x\|_\infty\le.6$ implies $\|x_0\|_\infty\le.6$, which supplies the smaller operand required by the computed convolution.
- S5.5.2: The computed chirp transform is $\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot y_0)$ with $y_0=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0)$.
  Source: "Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}y_0)" (paper)
  > Let $\widetilde a$ be the resulting disk-grid array, so $\|\widetilde a-a\|_\infty<2\,2^{-p}$. For a disk-grid target tensor $x$ of norm at most $.6$, the computed chirp transform forms the arrays \[ \begin{aligned} x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x),\\ y_0&=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0),\\ \widetilde{\mathscr C}(x) &=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}y_0). \end{aligned} \] Thus $\widetilde a$ is the convolution kernel and $x_0$ is the data operand after the first endpoint phase. Replacing the approximations by exact phases and exact convolution gives $\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}\mathcal M_{\mathbb C} (a,\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}x)=QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$ by \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp}. Below we show that $\|x\|_\infty\le.6$ implies $\|x_0\|_\infty\le.6$, which supplies the smaller operand required by the computed convolution.
- S5.5.3: The exact counterpart of the source transform is $\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A=RF_{\boldsymbol s}$.
  Source: "\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A" (paper)
  > For a source disk-grid tensor of norm at most $.5$, write $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ for the following procedure: apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal A$, apply the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$, apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal B_0$, and multiply the grid numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$. Its exact counterpart is \[ \mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A =RF_{\boldsymbol s}. \] Here an exact counterpart replaces every numerical subroutine by the exact map it approximates and omits truncations. The source arrays are stored in the padded power-of-two box, with zeros outside the valid source coordinates. The compressed scalar output uses $w_{\rm c}$-bit components. Appending $\gamma$ zero bits to each word gives the exact scaled numerator in the known signed width $w_{\rm c}+\gamma$. For the stated input norm, the disk estimate below proves that every scaled coordinate still belongs to $\mathbb D_p$. Its component numerators therefore have magnitude at most $2^p$, so a scan removes only leading sign-extension bits and returns the same integers in $w_{\rm c}$ bits. This scan costs $O(T(w_{\rm c}+\gamma))=O(Tp)$ and leaves the padded zero records zero. Define the opposite-sign procedure by \[ \widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z) =\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}; \] its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}.

**S5.6**: The algorithm: read radix digits, apply $\Phi$, compute the source transforms $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(u)$, $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(v)$, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, rescale by $S$ and $2^{2b+4}S$, round, undo $\Phi$ and propagate carries to output exactly $2n$ bits.
How: Write each radix digit $a_j$ as the exact grid value $a_j2^{-b-2}$ so inputs have norm below $1/4$, and run six explicit operations whose exact counterpart is $(u*v)/S^2$ scaled back to the integer coefficient convolution.
- S5.6.1: For digit $a_j$ write the exact grid numerator $a_j2^{p-b-2}$ in a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit real word followed by a zero imaginary word, represented value $a_j2^{-b-2}$ (nonnegative exponent because $p=6b$); append $S-q$ zero records.
  Source: "$a_j2^{p-b-2}$ in a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit real word, followed by a zero" (paper)
  > The source-transform procedures now supply the three transforms needed for the radix-digit convolution. Read each stored operand backward from its least significant end in groups of $b$ bits. This produces the radix-$2^b$ digits $a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}$ in increasing coefficient order. Buffer each group on a fixed work tape and read it back most significant bit first, reversing its least-significant-first input order; pad the final short group with leading zeroes. For digit $a_j$, write the exact grid numerator $a_j2^{p-b-2}$ in a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit real word, followed by a zero $w_{\rm c}$-bit imaginary word. This exponent is nonnegative because $p=6b$, and the represented value is exactly $a_j2^{-b-2}$. Append $S-q$ zero coefficient records. Buffering and ordering the groups costs $O(n)$, including the one partial group's padding, and writing the $S$ records costs $O(Sp)$. Together with the initial count and copies, this input conversion costs $O(n+Sp)=O(Tp)$; all $n$ input bits, including leading zeroes, are retained before the final group is padded.
- S5.6.2: Step 1: apply the coefficient-address map $\Phi$ with its padded layout to obtain source arrays $u,v$ of exact $p$-bit grid values of norm less than $1/4$.

- S5.6.8: The two occurrences of $S$ undo different normalizations: the exact counterpart after three transforms is $(u*v)/S^2$, so after the first scale it is $w=(u*v)/S$, and the second scale gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$.

By \eqref{eq:source-permutation-cancel}, the exact counterpart after the three transforms is $(u*v)/S^2$, so after the first scale it is $w=(u*v)/S$. The second scale gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$, whose inverse image under $\Phi$ is the original integer coefficient convolution. The next subsection verifies the disk bounds needed by every call and proves that the final error is less than $1/2$; it also justifies the rounding, carries, and output length.

- S5.3 (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-map.md)): The Chinese-remainder map $\Phi:\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\to\mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_i^{s_i}-1)$, $x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$, is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution, and it (with its inverse and padding) is implemented by triangular controlled shifts in $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ time.
- S5.4 (on [Phase twist](phase-twist.md)): With $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$ the map $\Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\to\mathcal R_r$, $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$, is an isomorphism multiplying coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k$; hence normalized complex cyclic convolution is $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=f*g/T$.
- S5.7 (on [Error tracking and exact recovery](precision-recovery.md)): The error on the recovered integer coefficients is below $1/2$, so rounding gives the exact integer coefficients, and carry propagation yields the exact binary product.

- [Multiplication as radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md): Splitting each integer into radix-2^b digits turns the product into a convolution of short integer coefficients, which carry propagation turns back into a binary number.

- [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-map.md): An isomorphism that places a cyclic convolution of length S = s₁⋯s_d on pairwise coprime prime axes, implemented as triangular controlled shifts.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Chinese-remainder address map
- [Retained permutation cancellation](retained-permutations.md): Leaving the coordinate permutations of resampling inside the transform identity, so the source permutation cancels across the two forward transforms and the opposite one and none is executed as a sort.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Retained permutation cancellation
- [Phase twist](phase-twist.md): Multiplying coefficient k by e^{πik/r}, which converts the cyclic coordinate modulo x^r − 1 into the negacyclic ring modulo y^r + 1 and is removed afterwards.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Phase twist
- [Convolution from the retained transform layout](ring-convolution.md): Convolution over the ring modulo y^r + 1 on the remaining axes by two forward synthetic transforms, pointwise polynomial products and the opposite transform, normalized by 1/(rM).
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Convolution from the retained transform layout
- [Parameter and prime-length choice](parameter-choice.md): Fixed rational exponents and sizes (precision p = 6b, d axes, K = d^c, T and r powers of two, prime lengths s_i just below t_i) making every hypothesis of the lemmas hold.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Parameter and prime-length choice
- [Error tracking and exact recovery](precision-recovery.md): Each normalized transform and product is a contraction with a bounded rounding error, and the total error on the recovered convolution coefficients is below 1/2, so rounding gives exact integers.

## Pages that build on this one

- Cost accounting and the exponent κ: Dividing each cost by V = Tp, the dominant terms are powers of p below one with minimum margin 2^{-181} = 2κ, giving total time O(n(lg n)^{1−κ}).
- Power-saving integer multiplication: A deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplying two n-bit integers exactly in O(n(lg n)^{1−κ}) time with κ = 2^{−182}, disproving the n log n optimality conjecture in this model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The multiplication algorithm" (paper)

  > \subsection{The multiplication algorithm}

- "The two occurrences of $S$ in this algorithm undo different normalizations." (paper)

  > The two occurrences of $S$ in this algorithm undo different normalizations. By \eqref{eq:source-permutation-cancel}, the exact counterpart after the three transforms is $(u*v)/S^2$, so after the first scale it is $w=(u*v)/S$. The second scale gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$, whose inverse image under $\Phi$ is the original integer coefficient convolution. The next subsection verifies the disk bounds needed by every call and proves that the final error is less than $1/2$; it also justifies the rounding, carries, and output length.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0038-write-multiplication-algorithm.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0038-write-multiplication-algorithm.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0038-write-multiplication-algorithm` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0038-write-multiplication-algorithm`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
