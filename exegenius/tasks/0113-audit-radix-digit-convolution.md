# exegenius task 0113-audit-radix-digit-convolution

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

A term, symbol or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term, symbol or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- symbol: notation used without being defined on the page.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Radix-digit convolution

To multiply two integers $x, y$ as in [exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md), let $b \ge 1$ be a digit width and write both inputs in radix $2^b$. Each input has $q = \lceil n/b \rceil$ digits, so $x = \sum_{k} a_k 2^{bk}$ and $y = \sum_{l} b_l 2^{bl}$, with each digit in $[0, 2^b)$. The digits are the coefficient lists of two polynomials in a variable $z$ with $z = 2^b$.

The product of the inputs is then the product of two polynomials evaluated at $z = 2^b$. The coefficients of the product polynomial form the [linear convolution](linear-convolution.md) of the digit lists:

$$c_j = \sum_{k + l = j} a_k b_l,$$

and $xy = \sum_j c_j 2^{bj}$. Each $c_j$ is an integer with $0 \le c_j \le q(2^b - 1)^2$. In the paper's setting $q \le n \le 2^b$, which gives $c_j < 2^{3b}$, so every coefficient fits in $3b$ bits.

A small example uses $b = 2$, so the radix is $4$. Take $x = 13 = 3 \cdot 4 + 1$ and $y = 11 = 2 \cdot 4 + 3$. Written least-significant digit first, the digits are $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 2)$. The convolution gives $c_0 = 1 \cdot 3 = 3$, $c_1 = 1 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 3 = 11$, and $c_2 = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$. Then $3 + 11 \cdot 4 + 6 \cdot 16 = 143 = 13 \cdot 11$.

The coefficients $c_j$ can exceed $2^b$, so the final integer is obtained by propagating carries from low to high coefficients. The convolution has length at most $2q - 1$, so it can be computed as a [cyclic convolution](cyclic-convolution.md) of any length $S \ge 2q - 1$ without wraparound. This is the reduction that the rest of the algorithm accelerates.
