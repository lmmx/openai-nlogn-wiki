# exegenius task 0020-write-bluestein-chirp

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/D1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

They know complex numbers and polynomials, and basic multitape Turing machines.

## This page

Concept: Bluestein chirp identity and phase twist
Gloss: Rewriting a transform as a cyclic convolution via chirps; a phase twist turns the last cyclic axis into a negacyclic polynomial modulo y^r+1.

## This page in the argument

The step: Bluestein's chirp identity and a phase twist turn the middle transform into a convolution whose last axis is negacyclic modulo $y^r+1$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) with power savings, use them in synthetic transforms, and place those in the reduction of multiplication to convolution (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ))](main-result.md))
- The product of two $n$-bit integers is reduced step by step to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, recovered exactly, and its total cost is bounded.; how: Chain reductions (digits, prime axes, power-of-two axes, polynomial ring), then recover the product and account for every cost term

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Discrete Fourier transform and roots of unity](dft.md): The transform evaluating a coefficient list at powers of a primitive root of unity; it turns convolution into pointwise product.
  Shown as: Bluestein chirp identity and phase twist *<predicate>* Discrete Fourier transform and roots of unity
- [Convolution and cyclic convolution](convolution.md): The product of two coefficient lists as polynomials, with indices optionally wrapped around cyclically.
  Shown as: Bluestein chirp identity and phase twist *<predicate>* Convolution and cyclic convolution
- [Polynomial ring modulo y^r+1](negacyclic-ring.md): Complex polynomials of degree below r with y^r = -1, so powers of y act as roots of unity and multiplication by y^a is a signed shift of coefficients.
  Shown as: Bluestein chirp identity and phase twist *<predicate>* Polynomial ring modulo y^r+1

## Pages that build on this one

- Retaining permutations in the transform: The source permutation from resampling cancels across the two forward transforms, the pointwise product and the inverse transform, avoiding separate full sorts.
- Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)): A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)) time with κ=2^-182, disproving the n log n optimality conjecture in this model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform,
including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution." (paper)

  > Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution. A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$; its negative wrap gives precisely the original cyclic wrap after the twist is removed. Sections~\ref{sec:synthetic-layouts} and~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products} compute convolution on the remaining axes over this polynomial ring. The two forward synthetic transforms retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes that order. Their polynomial products use signed packing and the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0020-write-bluestein-chirp.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0020-write-bluestein-chirp.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0020-write-bluestein-chirp` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0020-write-bluestein-chirp`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them.
