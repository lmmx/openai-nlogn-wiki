# exegenius task 0027-write-phase-kernel-c

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has done an undergraduate computer science degree: discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes and gcd, sets, induction, recurrences and asymptotics), basic linear algebra over the reals and complex numbers (matrices, inverses, norms), polynomials and complex roots of unity, and algorithms including divide and conquer and Karatsuba multiplication. On the machine side they know basic single- and multi-tape Turing machines and the idea of counting steps. They have not studied the Fourier transform, FFT-based multiplication, Schonhage-Strassen, Harvey-van der Hoeven, numerical error analysis, abstract algebra beyond rings of residues, finite-field linear algebra, or any lower-bound or advanced tape-algorithm technique, so those must be explained.

## This page

Concept: Two-point kernel C and phase frames
Gloss: The matrix C = H S H = aI + bX with C^2 = X and H_0 = b S C S, so a butterfly layer is a phase-conjugated tensor power of C.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- In the complex network with binary labels, every edge's phase-frame difference is a product of translation kernels $aI+bX_v$, one per vector of an orthonormal basis of the edge residual, with total length $s_{\rm c}<W_{\rm c}m$, and the frames telescope to $C^{\otimes m}$ on every role. (on [Complex phase network](complex-phase-network.md))
- Applying $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ to the same bit position of up to $d$ address chunks of $K$ bits at once, exactly in dyadic arithmetic with a single final truncation, takes $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. (on [Simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Radix-2 butterflies and FFT](fft-butterfly.md): Computing a power-of-two transform by repeated two-point butterflies (u,v) ↦ ((u+v)/2,(u−v)/2) followed by twiddle multiplications and smaller transforms (decimation in frequency).
  Shown as: Two-point kernel C and phase frames *<predicate>* Radix-2 butterflies and FFT

## Pages that build on this one

- Complex phase network: The complex-scalar version of the exchange network with binary labels whose phase frames i^{wt(Px)} reduce to translation kernels aI + bX_v, giving C^{⊗m} on every role with s_c < W_c m.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "H_0=b\mathsf SC\mathsf S,\qquad C^2=X,\qquad C^4=I,\qquad" (paper)

  > Put \[ H_0=\frac12\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix},\qquad H=\sqrt2 H_0,\qquad \mathsf S=\operatorname{diag}(1,i),\qquad Z=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1). \] For the bit-flip matrix $X=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$, define \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-C} C=H\mathsf SH=aI+bX,\qquad a=\frac{1+i}{2},\quad b=\frac{1-i}{2}. \end{equation} Direct multiplication gives \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-basic-identities} H_0=b\mathsf SC\mathsf S,\qquad C^2=X,\qquad C^4=I,\qquad C^{-1}=bI+aX=-iZCZ. \end{equation} In particular, $C=iZC^{-1}Z$. These identities use only Gaussian dyadic coefficients. The Hadamard matrices in the definition of $\mathcal C_U$ are used to prove identities; they need not be executed by the machine.

- "H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_D C^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D." (paper)

  > \paragraph{Returning to normalized butterflies.} For an address $x$ in a full layer, write $x_1,\ldots,x_D$ for its selected bits. The diagonal operator $\mathcal S_D$ multiplies the value stored at an address by the phase determined by those bits: \[ (\mathcal S_D z)(x)=i^{x_1+\cdots+x_D}z(x). \] Here the unselected address bits are unchanged, and the same phase is applied to every coefficient stored at that address. Applying \eqref{eq:phase-basic-identities} on all selected coordinates gives \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-butterfly-layer} H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_D C^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D. \end{equation} The scalar is \[ b^D=(-i/2)^{\lfloor D/2\rfloor}b^{D\bmod2}, \] so it is a binary shift and fourth-root phase, with at most one further factor $b$. All phases, inverse wrappers, and scalar corrections above are exact Gaussian dyadic operations. Thus, once the physical binary basis changes and recursive stream layout are supplied, the complete parallel butterfly layer is exact up to its prescribed final truncation.

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0027-write-phase-kernel-c.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0027-write-phase-kernel-c.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0027-write-phase-kernel-c` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0027-write-phase-kernel-c`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
