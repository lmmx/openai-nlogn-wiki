# exegenius task 0424-audit-diagonal-scaling

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Diagonal scaling

A diagonal scaling is a linear operator that multiplies each coordinate of a vector by its own fixed scalar. It is the phase step of the argument, because the paper's [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md) is built from diagonal phase operations:

A diagonal scaling is an operator built from the linear maps of [Linear algebra basics](linear-algebra-basics.md). Let $F$ be the field of scalars, and let $\mathcal I$ be the finite set of coordinate labels, one for each coordinate of the vectors. Each label $\iota\in\mathcal I$ names one coordinate, and $x_\iota$ is the value of a vector $x$ at that coordinate. Write $F^{\mathcal I}$ for the vector space of arrays $x=(x_\iota)_{\iota\in\mathcal I}$ with entries $x_\iota\in F$. Given a family of scalars $\tau=(\tau_\iota)_{\iota\in\mathcal I}$ with each $\tau_\iota\in F$, the diagonal scaling $\Delta_\tau$ is the map

$$(\Delta_\tau x)_\iota=\tau_\iota\,x_\iota \qquad\text{for every } \iota\in\mathcal I.$$

Each output coordinate depends on only one input coordinate, and it does so linearly. So $\Delta_\tau(x+y)=\Delta_\tau x+\Delta_\tau y$ and $\Delta_\tau(cx)=c\,\Delta_\tau x$ for vectors $x,y$ and scalars $c\in F$. Its matrix has $\tau_\iota$ in position $(\iota,\iota)$ and zeros elsewhere, which is where the name comes from.

The phase operator used by the butterfly layer is a diagonal scaling. Its index set is the set of addresses, and the scalar at each address is a power of the imaginary unit $i$ fixed by that address's selected bits. In the paper's notation, determined by those bits, so the scalar at an address depends on that address alone. stored at that address.

Two facts follow from the definition. First, $\Delta_\tau$ is invertible exactly when every $\tau_\iota$ is nonzero. If all are nonzero, the scaling $\Delta_{\tau^{-1}}$ with $(\tau^{-1})_\iota=1/\tau_\iota$ is a two-sided inverse, because the $\iota$-th coordinate of $\Delta_{\tau^{-1}}\Delta_\tau x$ is $\tau_\iota^{-1}\tau_\iota x_\iota=x_\iota$. If some $\tau_{\iota_0}=0$, the vector with a $1$ in coordinate $\iota_0$ and $0$ elsewhere is sent to $0$, so the map is not injective. Second, $\Delta_\tau\Delta_\sigma=\Delta_{\tau\sigma}$, where $(\tau\sigma)_\iota=\tau_\iota\sigma_\iota$, so diagonal scalings compose by multiplying their scalars coordinatewise.

Worked example. Take $F=\mathbb{C}$, $\mathcal I=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $\tau=(1,\,i,\,-1,\,-i)$. For $x=(2,\,1+i,\,0,\,3)$,
$$\Delta_\tau x=(2,\;i(1+i),\;0,\;-3i)=(2,\;-1+i,\;0,\;-3i).$$
The inverse scalings are $\tau^{-1}=(1,\,-i,\,-1,\,i)$, and applying $\Delta_{\tau^{-1}}$ to the result gives $(2,\;-i(-1+i),\;0,\;i(-3i))=(2,\;1+i,\;0,\;3)=x$, as the composition rule predicts.
