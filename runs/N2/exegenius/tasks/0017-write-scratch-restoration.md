Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e5/N2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Restoring arbitrary scratch values
Gloss: A schedule that subtracts the effect of the old auxiliary values, adds the source effect, and undoes the auxiliary updates, so the net effect is independent of arbitrary initial scratch contents.
Also called: transparent computation

## This page in the argument

The step: A schedule that first subtracts the effect of the old scratch values, then adds the source effect, then undoes the scratch updates, has a net effect independent of the arbitrary initial scratch contents.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine computes the exact $2n$-bit product of two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in that model.; how: build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) from finite linear networks with a rank deficit, assemble them into the transform-based convolution algorithm, prove exact recovery and bound the total time (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two fixed finite linear networks, one over $\mathbb F_2$ and one over $\mathbb Z[i,1/2]$, exchange two data banks while restoring every scratch wire, and admit frames whose edge changes need $s$ smaller calls in total with $s<Wm$.; how: build the scalar exchange from three-subset invocations, attach nested subspace labels to its gates, and count the residual dimensions on the edges (on [Rank deficit s < Wm](rank-deficit.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Linear networks, wires and roles](linear-network.md): A fixed finite network of wires carrying scalars, acted on by pointwise linear gates; a wire's fixed place in the network is its role.
  Shown as: Restoring arbitrary scratch values *<predicate>* Linear networks, wires and roles

## Pages that build on this one

- Three-element subset construction: Gates indexed by 3-subsets of a 100-element set: gather and scatter through central wires give coefficients depending on intersection size, and side wires between neighbouring subsets cancel the unwanted ones, so a forward invocation adds x to y.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The first two rows of the following schedule remove the effect of the old scratch values;" (paper)

  > bb F_2$, and $S,T$ are neighbors when $|S\cap T|=1$. The copy map adds $x_T$ to $A_{ST}$ for each neighbor pair. The side injection adds $\sum_{T:\,|S\cap T|=1}A_{ST}$ to $y_S$. The gather adds $\sum_{T\ni i}x_T$ to $C_i$, and the scatter adds $\sum_{i\in S}C_i$ to $y_S$. \item In the complex construction, scalars lie in $\mathbb Z[i,1/2]$, and neighbors are distinct triples with even intersection. Copy is unchanged. Side injection adds \[ -\sum_{T\text{ neighboring }S}\frac{|S\cap T|-1}{2}A_{ST} \] to $y_S$. Gather adds $\sum_{T\ni i}x_T$ to $C_i$ and $\sum_Tx_T$ to $C_\ast$. Scatter adds $(\sum_{i\in S}C_i-C_\ast)/2$ to $y_S$. \end{itemize} Each update leaves its control wires unchanged. The first two rows of the following schedule remove the effect of the old scratch values; the next four introduce the source values and add their effect to the target; the last two restore the scratch values. This cancellation of arbitrary initial scratch values is a linear instance of the restoration construction for transparent computation in Buhrman, Cleve, Kouck\'y, Loff and Speelman~\cite[Section~3]{BuhrmanCleveKouckyLoffSpeelman2014}. The forward schedule is \begin{equation} \begin{array}{c|l|l} \text{row}&\text{operation}&\text{gate grouping}\\ \hline 0&\text{subtract side injection}&\text{one gate per target}\\ 1&\text{subtract scatter}&\text{one gate on targets and center}\\ 2&\text{copy}&\text{one gate per source}\\ 3&\text{gather}&\text{one gate on sources and center}\\ 4&

- "Our scratch schedule is the linear-readout version of that construction." (paper)

  > Restoring scratch registers with arbitrary initial contents also has a precise precedent. The transparent-computation construction of Buhrman, Cleve, Kouck\'y, Loff and Speelman subtracts an initial register value, performs a computation, adds the resulting value, and reverses the computation~\cite[Section~3]{BuhrmanCleveKouckyLoffSpeelman2014}. Our scratch schedule is the linear-readout version of that construction. The rank reduction used for address shears is a singular-matrix Bruhat factorization: after reversing the coordinate order, Grigor'ev's upper-triangular factors become the two lower-triangular factors needed here~\cite[Appendix~A.2, Proposition~14(c)]{Grigoriev1982}.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-scratch-restoration.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-scratch-restoration.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0017-write-scratch-restoration` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-scratch-restoration`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
