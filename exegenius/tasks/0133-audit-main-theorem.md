# exegenius task 0133-audit-main-theorem

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source, which the reader can consult: it is followable by reference, so do not report it as a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has completed an undergraduate computer science degree: big-O analysis, polynomials and complex numbers, and Turing machines with tapes, plus the discrete mathematics and first linear algebra course that such a degree requires. For the paper this means modular arithmetic, gcd and primes, roots of unity, binary arithmetic over F2 with Hamming weight, and basic vector-space and matrix facts (subspaces, rank, projections, dot product, eigenvalues) at first-course depth. Bilinear forms, tensor products, finite-field and ring theory, the Chinese remainder theorem, Newton iteration and the Fourier and convolution machinery beyond the basics are treated as not known.

# Integer multiplication below n log n

Integer multiplication below $n\lg n$ is the main theorem: a single deterministic Turing machine that runs in the [fixed-tape machine model](fixed-tape-model.md) multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly, with its logarithmic factor reduced by a fixed power. The power is $\kappa=2^{-182}$, a fixed positive number, so the time is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$. It refutes the [n log n optimality conjecture](n-log-n-conjecture.md) in this model.

Without its constant factor, $n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa}=n\lg n\cdot(\lg n)^{-\kappa}$ is below $n\lg n$ for every $n\ge 3$. There $\lg n>1$ (since $\lg 3\approx 1.58$), so $(\lg n)^{-\kappa}<1$. The ratio to $n\lg n$ tends to $0$, so the order is strictly smaller.

The obstacle is the transform layers, the rounds of the transform. (cited) The transform calculation consists of address rearrangements, signed shifts and butterfly operations. (cited) Two tape procedures supply them.

A field is a block of consecutive address bits. The first procedure interchanges two disjoint equal address fields of $u$ bits in an array of stored volume $V$, in time $O(Vu^{\tau})$. (cited)

The second applies a [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md) to $d$ selected chunks, in time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$.

Multiplication is reduced to the [radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md) of the two integers' digit coefficients. It computes its transforms on a [transform layout](transform-layout.md) that places the selected bits of each axis at a common offset. It relabels its axis positions by the [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md). Its movement is organized by [rank-saving recursion](rank-saving-recursion.md). The transform identity is based on the [transform identity with retained permutations](transform-identity.md), so permutations cancel instead of being sorted. It chooses its source lengths as [prime source lengths](prime-source-lengths.md). It converts the last cyclic coordinate by a [phase twist](phase-twist.md). It multiplies its records by [convolution over the polynomial ring](polynomial-ring-convolution.md). It adds selected bits with [packed selected-bit addition](packed-bit-addition.md).

It recovers its coefficients by [exact coefficient recovery](recovery-and-error.md), which rounds them to integers. The result ends with [carry propagation](carry-propagation.md).

Rational parameters are then chosen so that every term of the cost table fits the bound, and the total cost is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$. (cited)
