# exegenius task 0006-write-poly-ring-mod-yr1

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/B3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

## This page

Concept: Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1
Gloss: Polynomials in y with complex coefficients reduced by y^r = −1; powers of y act as roots of unity and multiplying by one is a signed shift of the coefficient list.
Heading: Polynomial ring modulo $y^r + 1$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $y$ (ring variable): The indeterminate of the polynomials, with y^r = -1.
- $r$ (number of coefficients): The number of coefficients in a polynomial, a power of two.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Applying $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ simultaneously on selected bits of at most $d$ address chunks of arrays of complex fixed-point polynomial records costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with a fixed $\lambda'<1$. (on [Simultaneous butterfly layer H₀](butterfly-layer.md))
- Normalized convolution over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ is computed exactly enough from synthetic transforms and packed polynomial products. (on [Exact normalized polynomial products](exact-ring-products.md))
- The synthetic transforms $F_t^{\pm}$ over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, with $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$, satisfy $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$. (on [Synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md))
- The synthetic transform runs on a tape layout where the parallel layers apply, keeping the frequency order, in the stated cost. (on [Transform layout with retained frequency order](transform-layout.md))
- Packing signed polynomial coefficients into one long integer turns a product in $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ into an integer product handled by the $O(n\log n)$ multiplier. (on [Signed coefficient packing (Kronecker substitution)](signed-packing.md))
- The twist $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ turns cyclic convolution of length $r$ into convolution modulo $y^r+1$, whose negative wrap gives the cyclic wrap after untwisting. (on [Coefficient twist to the polynomial ring](phase-twist.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Synthetic polynomial transforms: Fourier-type transforms over the polynomial ring where powers of y serve as roots of unity, built from address rearrangements, signed shifts and two-point butterflies (Nussbaumer).
- Coefficient twist to the polynomial ring: A twist x_d -> ζy turning cyclic convolution of length r into convolution modulo y^r+1, whose negative wrap gives exactly the cyclic wrap once untwisted.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.
