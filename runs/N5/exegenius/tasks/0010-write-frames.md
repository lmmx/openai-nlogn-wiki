Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e5/N5` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Concept: Frames and the common-frame identity
Gloss: Each source, gate and sink carries an invertible linear operator D_v on wire arrays; because a common frame commutes with a pointwise gate, the network applied to arrays implements D_out·S·D_in⁻¹, so only endpoint frames matter.
Also called: frame

## This page in the argument

The step: With an invertible frame $D_v$ at every source, gate and sink, the network on arrays implements $D_{\rm out}\mathsf S_\Omega D_{\rm in}^{-1}$, so each route applies only its endpoint frames.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: speed up address movement and butterfly arithmetic by recursive linear-network procedures, plug them into Harvey and van der Hoeven's reduction of multiplication to synthetic polynomial transforms, and bound the total cost (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Address-field interchange costs $O(Vu^\tau)$ and a simultaneous butterfly layer costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with fixed $\tau,\lambda'<1$, where $V$ is the stored bit volume.; how: turn a strict rank deficit of two finite linear networks into recursive power savings for both tape procedures
- There are two fixed linear networks, one over $\mathbb F_2$ and one over $\mathbb Z[i,1/2]$, each with $W$ wires, that exchange two banks of values, restore all scratch values, and admit nested subspace labels whose edge changes need only $s<Wm$ smaller calls in total.; how: build the scalar networks from triple-intersection gather/scatter with scratch restoration, lift them to arrays by frames, and count the residual dimensions of nested subspace labels (on [Rank deficit s < Wm](rank-deficit.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Linear network with wire roles](linear-network.md): A fixed finite circuit of wires carrying scalars and gates applying fixed linear maps; a wire's fixed place is its role, and auxiliary scratch wires may start with arbitrary values.
  Shown as: Frames and the common-frame identity *<predicate>* Linear network with wire roles

## Pages that build on this one

- Nested subspace labels and orthogonal residuals: Each gate and terminal is labelled by a nondegenerate subspace of a fixed m-dimensional bilinear space, nested along edges; the orthogonal residual of an edge measures how many smaller operations its frame change needs.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "We call $D_v$ its frame: the stored array is $D_vg$ when the logical array is $g$." (paper)

  > The representation of a role's array may change along the network. At a source, gate, or sink $v$, choose an invertible linear operator $D_v$ on the space of arrays indexed by the common address set. We call $D_v$ its frame: the stored array is $D_vg$ when the logical array is $g$. All incidences of one gate have the same frame. Along an edge from $u$ to $v$, the operator $D_vD_u^{-1}$ changes the stored array from $D_ug$ to $D_vg$. At a pointwise linear gate $G$, the common frame commutes with the gate: \[ G(D_vg_1,\ldots,D_vg_t)=D_vG(g_1,\ldots,g_t). \] The supplied input needs no preliminary change of frame: its logical interpretation is defined by applying the inverse input frame. Thus the intermediate frames cancel, and a route from input role $w$ to output role $\rho(w)$ applies $D_{\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))}D_{\mathrm{source}(w)}^{-1}$, together with its prescribed scalar sign. Undoing the role exchange and those signs leaves the endpoint operator on every role array, including the roles that carried auxiliary scalar values.

- "Thus the common frame commutes with the pointwise gate, and the invariant continues to the sinks." (paper)

  > all input and output roles by \[ D_{\rm in}=\bigoplus_w D_{\mathrm{source}(w)},\qquad D_{\rm out}=\bigoplus_w D_{\mathrm{sink}(w)}. \] For a supplied physical input $f$, define its logical interpretation to be $g=D_{\rm in}^{-1}f$; this definition requires no physical preprocessing. At a vertex $v$, the invariant is that the stored array equals $D_v$ applied to the logical array there. It holds at the sources by definition. On an edge whose logical array is $\varphi$, the edge operator changes $D_u\varphi$ to $D_v\varphi$. At a gate with logical input arrays $\varphi_j$, $R$-linearity gives $\sum_j c_jD_v\varphi_j=D_v(\sum_j c_j\varphi_j)$ for each output combination, with $c_j\in R$. Thus the common frame commutes with the pointwise gate, and the invariant continues to the sinks. The implemented operator is therefore \begin{equation} D_{\rm out}\,\mathsf S_\Omega\,D_{\rm in}^{-1}. \label{eq:common-frame-identity} \end{equation} In particular, if the scalar network is a signed role permutation that sends input role $w$ to output role $\rho(w)$ with scalar sign $\varepsilon_w$, that route applies $\varepsilon_wD_{\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))} D_{\mathrm{source}(w)}^{-1}$ to its input array. All roles, including the auxiliary roles, enter this identity. Once the scalar routing is fixed, the endpoint frames determine the array operator on each route; the intermediate frames can then be chosen to make each edge change inexpensive.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-frames.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-frames.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0010-write-frames` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-frames`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
