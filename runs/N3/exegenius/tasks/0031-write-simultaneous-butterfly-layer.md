Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e5/N3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Simultaneous butterfly layer
Gloss: Applying H₀ on the same bit position of up to d address chunks at once in O(V d^{λ'}) time with λ' < 1, by recursing through the complex network's phase frames, packed bit changes and an exact Gaussian-dyadic evaluation with one final truncation.
Also called: parallel butterfly layer

## This page in the argument

The step: A normalized butterfly $H_0$ on the same bit of up to $d$ address chunks can be applied to polynomial records in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with $\lambda'<1$ and a single final truncation.
How: express $H_0^{\otimes D}$ through $C^{\otimes D}$, recurse through the complex network's phase frames, implement binary basis changes by packed selected-bit additions, bound guard widths, and evaluate exactly before truncating
Why: Separate butterfly factors would each cost a whole-array pass; the complex network replaces them by fewer, smaller recursive calls on volume V/W. (the sources say so: "factors would require $D$ whole-array passes." (paper))
Striking feature: All $D$ butterfly factors together cost only $d^{\lambda'}$ passes with $\lambda'<1$ instead of $D$ passes. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The phase-frame construction reduces $C^{\otimes e}$ on a group of $e=mf$ selected bits to $s_{\rm c}$ child calls on $f$ bits, with all wrappers exact Gaussian dyadic operations, and $H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_DC^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D$.
- Selected bits of one address chunk can be XORed into another, restoring a third scratch chunk, in time $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ on the transform layouts. (on [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md))
- With rows split among the roles, the normalized cost obeys $F(e)\le(s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)$, which unrolls to $O(d^{\lambda'})$.
- Denominator and magnitude growth inside one layer is bounded by $\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil=o(p)$ bits, so exact evaluation fits in $O(p)$-bit words.
- The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal Hz)$ in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine computes the exact product of two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in that model.; how: build two sublinear-per-level tape procedures from finite linear networks with a rank deficit, then chain the known reductions from integer product to synthetic polynomial transforms and bound every cost (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Interchanging $u$-bit address chunks costs $O(Vu^\tau)$ and a simultaneous butterfly layer on $d$ chunks costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with $\tau,\lambda'<1$.; how: supply linear elementary scans, build two finite networks with a rank deficit, and turn each network into a volume-normalized recursion on tape

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.5.1, S1.5.3, S1.5.4, S1.5.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.5.1**: The phase-frame construction reduces $C^{\otimes e}$ on a group of $e=mf$ selected bits to $s_{\rm c}$ child calls on $f$ bits, with all wrappers exact Gaussian dyadic operations, and $H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_DC^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D$.
Source: "parallel butterfly layer is exact up to its prescribed final truncation." (paper)
> \paragraph{Returning to normalized butterflies.} For an address $x$ in a full layer, write $x_1,\ldots,x_D$ for its selected bits. The diagonal operator $\mathcal S_D$ multiplies the value stored at an address by the phase determined by those bits: \[ (\mathcal S_D z)(x)=i^{x_1+\cdots+x_D}z(x). \] Here the unselected address bits are unchanged, and the same phase is applied to every coefficient stored at that address. Applying \eqref{eq:phase-basic-identities} on all selected coordinates gives \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-butterfly-layer} H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_D C^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D. \end{equation} The scalar is \[ b^D=(-i/2)^{\lfloor D/2\rfloor}b^{D\bmod2}, \] so it is a binary shift and fourth-root phase, with at most one further factor $b$. All phases, inverse wrappers, and scalar corrections above are exact Gaussian dyadic operations. Thus, once the physical binary basis changes and recursive stream layout are supplied, the complete parallel butterfly layer is exact up to its prescribed final truncation.

**S1.5.3**: With rows split among the roles, the normalized cost obeys $F(e)\le(s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)$, which unrolls to $O(d^{\lambda'})$.
Source: "F(e)\le (s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)," (paper)
> \paragraph{Unrolling the recurrence.} Fix \(\beta=1/2\), and choose real exponents satisfying \[ 0<\tau<1,\qquad \max\{0,\log_m(s/W)\}\le\sigma<1, \qquad \max\{\tau,\sigma\}<\lambda<1, \qquad \tau(1+c/\beta)<\lambda. \] The exponents can all be chosen rational, with a strict upper bound in the condition on \(\sigma\). Stop recursion when \(e<d^\beta\) and apply the \(e\) \(C\) kernels individually. If \(F(e)\) denotes time divided by the current logical stream volume, then \[ F(e)\le (s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1), \qquad F(e)=O(e)\quad(e<d^\beta). \] Indeed, the \(s\) child calls are executed on streams of volume \(V/W\), so their total cost is \(s(V/W)F(e/m)\). Dividing by the current volume \(V\) gives the factor \(s/W\). At an internal node \(e\ge d^\beta\), hence \(K\le d^c\le e^{c/\beta}\). The overhead is therefore \(O(e^{\tau(1+c/\beta)}+1)=O(e^\lambda)\). Put \(a=s/W\). Since \(a\le m^\sigma<m^\lambda\), the internal costs sum to at most \[ C e^\lambda\sum_{j\ge0}(a/m^\lambda)^j=O(e^\lambda). \] If the leaves after \(j\) levels contain \(u=e/m^j<d^\beta\) active chunks each, their combined normalized contribution is at most \[ O(a^ju)\le O(e^\sigma u^{1-\sigma}) \le O(e^\sigma d^{\beta(1-\sigma)}). \] The first inequality uses \(a^j\le m^{j\sigma}=(e/u)^\sigma\). It also covers \(a<1\) by taking \(\sigma\ge0\).

**S1.5.4**: Denominator and magnitude growth inside one layer is bounded by $\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil=o(p)$ bits, so exact evaluation fits in $O(p)$-bit words.
Source: "The accelerated network is evaluated exactly until an entire" (paper)
> The accelerated network is evaluated exactly until an entire normalized butterfly layer is complete. Its intermediate operators need not be contractions. We now give explicit constants that bound denominator and magnitude growth within one layer.

**S1.5.5**: The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal Hz)$ in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$.
Source: "The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in the same array," (paper)
> The procedure returns $Q_p(\mathcal H z)$ in the same array, coefficient order, and component format in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time, uniformly over all these choices of $p,d,r,D,P,S,\rho,w$ and $z$. Every returned coefficient belongs to the complex unit disk, and, in the maximum coefficient norm, \[ \|Q_p(\mathcal H z)-\mathcal H z\|_\infty <\sqrt2\,2^{-p}. \] The procedure evaluates the entire layer exactly before this final truncation. Put \[ C_0=128m\bigl(s_{\rm c}+64(W_{\rm c}+m+1)^3\bigr)^2, \] where $m,W_{\rm c},s_{\rm c}$ are the fixed constants of Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface}. The procedure uses at most $p+\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil$ fractional bits and $\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil+3$ integer and sign bits per real component internally; these widths are $O(p)$. The time includes address changes, deterministic repair, row padding and its removal, and fixed-tape workspace cleanup. Its tape count is fixed, and its time constant is independent of the allowed array lengths and coefficient values. \end{proposition}

## Pages that build on this one

- Transform layout on K-bit chunks: The tape layout placing the selected address bits of all participating axes at a common offset in consecutive K-bit chunks, with polynomial coefficients in a contiguous suffix, so that each transform round is one simultaneous layer.
- Parameter choice and cost table: The setting b = ⌈log₂ n⌉, p = 6b, d = ⌊b^ε⌋, K = ⌊d^c⌋, power-of-two box T ≈ 4n/b, prime axis lengths s_i near t_i, and fixed rationals τ, λ', ε, κ = 2^{−182}, under which every normalized cost is at most p^{1−2κ}.
- Integer multiplication below n log n: There is one deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine computing the exact product of two n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) worst-case time with κ = 2^{−182}, by chaining radix-digit convolution, a CRT address map, Gaussian resampling with retained permutations, Bluestein chirps, a coefficient twist and synthetic transforms accelerated by fast chunk interchanges and simultaneous butterfly layers; this disproves the n log n optimality conjecture in that model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$." (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.

- "The entire layer is evaluated exactly before one final truncation." (paper)

  > We first construct tensor products of the auxiliary two-point kernel $C$ from Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface}. Its phase frames express a $C$ tensor product using smaller groups of selected bits, separated by binary changes of basis. We implement those changes by moving whole address chunks. Splitting complete rows among the network's wire roles then reduces the volume of each recursive call. Finally, we bound the intermediate dyadic values and convert the completed $C$ layer to the normalized $H_0$ layer. The entire layer is evaluated exactly before one final truncation.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0031-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0031-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0031-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0031-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
