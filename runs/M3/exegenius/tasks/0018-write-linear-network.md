# exegenius task 0018-write-linear-network

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/M3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Linear networks with roles and restored auxiliaries
Gloss: A fixed linear network exchanging two banks of values with signs and restoring every auxiliary value; rows of an array are distributed cyclically among W roles and gates apply pointwise.

## This page in the argument

The step: A fixed linear network exchanges two banks of values with signs and restores every auxiliary value, and rows of an array are distributed cyclically among its $W$ roles.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, with $p$ bits of working precision, $d$ transform axes of length about $r$.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution through a chain of representation changes, evaluate it with the two fast tape procedures, then recover the exact product and sum the costs (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures, the address interchange and the simultaneous butterfly layer, cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for fixed $\tau,\lambda'<1$ on stored bit volume $V$.; how: Obtain both procedures from fixed linear networks with a strict rank saving and recurse
- Two disjoint contiguous address fields of $u$ bits in a Cartesian-product array of volume $V$ can be interchanged in time $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$.; how: Build a fixed linear network with a rank saving, use it recursively on streams of volume $V/W$, and turn each edge into smaller interchanges (on [Fast interchange of address chunks](address-interchange.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Elementary stream operations and controlled shifts](stream-operations.md): Scans, array order, and shifts on tapes in linear time, forming the cost base for rearrangements.

## Pages that build on this one

- Frames and endpoint operators: Invertible linear operators D_v attached to gates; intermediate frames cancel so a route applies D_sink D_source^-1, leaving an endpoint operator such as an address shear or the H₀ layer.
- Lower triangular (Bruhat) factorization: Every rational matrix of rank a factors as E1 Π E2 with E1, E2 lower triangular and Π a partial permutation with a ones, so a shear of rank a needs only a smaller interchanges, in tape order.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Each procedure arises from its own fixed linear network that exchanges two" (paper)

  > Each procedure arises from its own fixed linear network that exchanges two banks of values, with prescribed signs, and restores every auxiliary value. A wire's fixed place in the network is called its role. To use the network on an array, regard a row as the complete ordered suffix, including all active address fields, at a fixed prefix and row index. Distribute rows cyclically among the $W$ roles, padding the row count for each prefix to a multiple of $W$. Let $V$ now denote the node volume after padding. All role streams have the same local address set and each contains $V/W$ bits. A scalar gate is then applied pointwise to matching addresses on the roles that it touches.

- "We construct two fixed linear networks that exchange two banks of values
while restoring every auxiliary value." (paper)

  > We construct two fixed linear networks that exchange two banks of values while restoring every auxiliary value. When the values are replaced by arrays, a common representation on all wires at a gate lets that gate act pointwise without disturbing the representation. We explain this invariant before constructing the subspace labels that make changes of representation cheap. The first network uses bit values and rational subspaces; the second uses Gaussian dyadic values and binary subspaces. The scalar domain specifies the values combined at a gate, while the subspace labels are used to construct operators on each wire's address-indexed array.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-linear-network.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-linear-network.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0018-write-linear-network` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-linear-network`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
