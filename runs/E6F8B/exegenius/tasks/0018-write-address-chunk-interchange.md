Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F8B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Address chunk interchange
Gloss: Interchanging two disjoint contiguous address fields of u bits of an array in O(V u^τ) time for a fixed τ<1, using XOR combinations of intermediate data although the final effect is an exact permutation.

## This page in the argument

The step: Two disjoint contiguous address chunks of $u$ bits of an array of volume $V$ can be interchanged in time $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$, although the intermediate steps form XOR combinations of data.
How: Build the interchange from elementary scans and controlled shifts and a fixed linear network with a rank saving for power widths, then pad to arbitrary widths.
Why: A network whose total edge rank is below the wire count times the dimension turns the interchange cost into a recurrence with a power saving, which a plain pass over the array per level cannot give. (the sources say so: "the resulting recurrence saves a power of the chunk width." (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Digit permutations, digit moves, digit splits and cyclic row splits of an array stored in lexicographic order each cost $O(V)$ on a fixed number of tapes. (on [Arrays as address fields on tape](tape-address-model.md))
- A target field in $[Q]$ that follows its control fields is shifted by an offset computed from the controls, modulo $Q$, in $O(V)$ time. (on [Controlled cyclic shift](controlled-cyclic-shift.md))
- For $e=m^k$, two disjoint chunks of $e$ radix-$q$ digits can be interchanged in time $O(Ve^\tau)$, provided a row field preceding both chunks has length divisible by $W^k$. (on [Power-width chunk interchange](power-width-interchange.md))
- An arbitrary width after the high digits is written in base $m$ and split into pieces of power widths, each interchanged by the power-width procedure on a padded row field.
- Padding the binary chunks of $u$ bits to radix-$q$ chunks and scanning away the padding gives the interchange of two $u$-bit chunks in $O(Vu^\tau)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution of radix digits evaluated by approximate Fourier transforms over a polynomial ring, make the transform's address movement and arithmetic cheaper with two new tape procedures, then show the result is exact and add up the cost. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.4, S1.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.4**: An arbitrary width after the high digits is written in base $m$ and split into pieces of power widths, each interchanged by the power-width procedure on a padded row field.
Source: "Proposition~\ref{prop:power-interchange} to each corresponding pair." (paper)
> Write the remaining width in base $m$: \[ e-\rho=\sum_{j=0}^{k} a_jm^j,\qquad 0\le a_j<m. \] Partition each remaining chunk into corresponding consecutive pieces, with $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$. Apply Proposition~\ref{prop:power-interchange} to each corresponding pair. All these calls use the same row field of length $R'$, which is divisible by each required $W^j$. At completion every call preserves its row address, so it neither mixes genuine rows with padded rows nor depends on the values used for padding. The padded zero rows remain zero at these completed-call boundaries. The sum of the costs is bounded by \[ O(V)\sum_j a_jm^{j\tau}=O(Ve^\tau). \] The fixed bound $a_j<m$ and the inequality $m^k<me$ make this a geometric sum of the stated order. Scan away the padded rows, then reverse only the moves that joined the high parts. This is the last transition in the field-order display: $h^+$ returns to the later high position, while $d^+$ stays in the earlier one. The final order is therefore the required interchange of the two full chunks. The remaining movement cost $O(V\log(2e))$ is $O(Ve^\tau)$. Computing the piece list and every new shape is polynomial in $\log(2V)$ per piece. There are at most $(m-1)(k+1)=O(\log(2e))$ pieces; since $V\ge q^{2e}$, their total descriptor cost is a fixed power of $\log(2V)$ and hence $O(V)$. Each power-width call uses the fixed schedule proved above and leaves its work tapes clean.

**S1.5**: Padding the binary chunks of $u$ bits to radix-$q$ chunks and scanning away the padding gives the interchange of two $u$-bit chunks in $O(Vu^\tau)$.
Source: "Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is" (paper)
> Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with $q^e\ge2^u$. Pad each of the two chunk ranges numerically from $[2^u]$ to $[q^e]$, putting zero in an entry if either chunk coordinate is invalid. The increase in volume is less than $q^2$, a fixed factor. The padding is a nested scan through consecutive valid and invalid intervals, with their lengths prepared from the shape. It costs $O(V)$ with a constant depending on $q$. Lexicographic radix-$q$ order of $[q^e]$ is its numerical order, just as binary order of $[2^u]$ is its numerical order. Padding therefore preserves the order of the existing entries without converting the digits of every address. The completed interchange preserves the set on which both chunk coordinates lie below $2^u$. Scan away the other entries to recover the desired binary array. Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is $O(Vu^\tau)$. \end{proof}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S1.1 (on [Arrays as address fields on tape](tape-address-model.md)): Digit permutations, digit moves, digit splits and cyclic row splits of an array stored in lexicographic order each cost $O(V)$ on a fixed number of tapes.
- S1.2 (on [Controlled cyclic shift](controlled-cyclic-shift.md)): A target field in $[Q]$ that follows its control fields is shifted by an offset computed from the controls, modulo $Q$, in $O(V)$ time.
- S1.3 (on [Power-width chunk interchange](power-width-interchange.md)): For $e=m^k$, two disjoint chunks of $e$ radix-$q$ digits can be interchanged in time $O(Ve^\tau)$, provided a row field preceding both chunks has length divisible by $W^k$.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Power-width chunk interchange](power-width-interchange.md): Interchanging two chunks of e=m^k digits in time O(V e^τ) by running the bit network on W role streams, with each edge shear implemented recursively by smaller interchanges.
  Shown as: Address chunk interchange *<predicate>* Power-width chunk interchange

## Pages that build on this one

- Chinese-remainder address map: An algebra isomorphism sending the radix-digit coefficient list onto a product of pairwise coprime cyclic axes while preserving convolution, implemented by triangular controlled shifts and axis reorderings.
- Packed selected-bit addition: XORing corresponding selected bits of many chunks at once by a constant number of whole-chunk cyclic shifts that are correct away from a small set of guard-violating addresses, which are then repaired deterministically by sorting.
- Transform layout on tape: Placing the selected bit of each participating axis at a common offset in consecutive K-bit chunks, using bit moves and chunk interchanges, so that each transform round is one simultaneous butterfly layer.
- Source transform on the padded box: The approximate source Fourier transform formed by linewise Gaussian maps A, the chirp convolution of length T on the padded power-of-two box, linewise B₀ and an exact 2^γ scale, equal to R F_s on the prime-length source.
- Cost accounting and the exponent κ: Dividing every cost by V=Tp gives normalized costs that are at most p^(1−2κ), the smallest margin 2^−181 coming from the chunk-exchange term, giving total time O(n(log n)^(1−κ)).

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-address-chunk-interchange.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-address-chunk-interchange.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0018-write-address-chunk-interchange` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-address-chunk-interchange`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
