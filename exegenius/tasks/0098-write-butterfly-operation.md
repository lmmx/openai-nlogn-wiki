# exegenius task 0098-write-butterfly-operation

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "two-point butterfly operations" (paper)

  > In this representation, the transform calculation consists of address rearrangements, signed shifts, and two-point butterfly operations. Scanning an array of $\Theta(n)$ stored bits at each of $\Theta(\log n)$ transform levels already costs $\Theta(n\log n)$. We therefore need savings in both movement and arithmetic. Two tape procedures supply them; in both bounds, $V$ denotes the stored bit volume.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- Cite or cut this step: "a transform on $n$ values is built from two transforms on $n/2$ values, followed by one layer that combines them pairwise" (The page asserts this construction, but does not say what the combining layer computes, why it yields the transform, or where it is justified; the reader cannot check that the split is correct. The level count that follows depends on it.). It is inside reasoning added for an earlier step, so do not explain it further: cite the source for it, or remove the claim.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Since $H_0^2=I$, applying the butterfly twice returns the original pair." (The claim is false: with H_0 = (1/2)[[1,1],[1,-1]], H_0^2 = (1/4)(2I) = I/2, so applying the butterfly twice gives (u,v)/2, not (u,v). The example H_0(3,1)=(2,1) applied again gives (3/2,1/2), not (3,1). The reader cannot establish the stated identity from the page.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- Explain "signed shifts and address rearrangements" in a sentence where it is first used.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 217 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 271 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

The butterfly operation is the two-point map that serves as the basic step of a fast transform: a transform on many values is assembled from layers that apply it to pairs of values.

Write $u$ and $v$ for two input values; the two-point butterfly $H_0$ maps them to $\left(\frac{u+v}{2}, \frac{u-v}{2}\right)$. In matrix form on column vectors,
$$H_0=\frac12\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}.$$
For example, $H_0(3,1)=(2,1)$. Since $H_0^2=I$, applying the butterfly twice returns the original pair.

The butterfly is a scaled length-2 case of the [discrete Fourier transform](fourier-transform.md). The length-2 transform uses the root of unity $-1$ and returns the unscaled sums $u+v$ and $u-v$. The factor $\frac12$ keeps magnitudes from growing across layers, since $\left|\frac{u\pm v}{2}\right|\le\max(|u|,|v|)$.

The paper's transform calculation uses address rearrangements, signed shifts, and the butterfly steps <cite data-source="paper">two-point butterfly operations</cite>. Its number of levels is logarithmic because each level halves the block size: a transform on $n$ values is built from two transforms on $n/2$ values, followed by one layer that combines them pairwise, and this splitting repeats until each block holds a single value. For $n$ a power of two this gives exactly $\log_2 n$ levels. Here $\Theta(\log n)$ denotes a count lying between two positive constant multiples of $\log n$.

Each butterfly touches only two values, so the cost of a level is set by how many pairs it processes. A [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md) applies the same butterfly to one address bit of every record at once.
