# exegenius task 0023-write-rank-deficit

Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e5/N2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Rank deficit s < Wm
Gloss: The decisive property of each finite network: the total number s of smaller calls needed on its edges is strictly less than the number of wires W times the label dimension m.
Heading: Rank deficit $s < Wm$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $s$ (smaller call count): The total number of smaller recursive calls, summed over all edges of the network.
- $W$ (wire count): The number of wires (roles) in the network, including scratch wires.
- $m$ (label dimension): The dimension of the ambient label space, equal to the number of digit fields or selected axes a call is split into.

## This page in the argument

The step: Two fixed finite linear networks, one over $\mathbb F_2$ and one over $\mathbb Z[i,1/2]$, exchange two data banks while restoring every scratch wire, and admit frames whose edge changes need $s$ smaller calls in total with $s<Wm$.
How: build the scalar exchange from three-subset invocations, attach nested subspace labels to its gates, and count the residual dimensions on the edges
Why: Turning each edge's change of frame into smaller calls of the same procedure only pays off if the total number of such calls is less than wires times label dimension; keeping the dimension lost on decreasing edges small achieves that. (the sources say so: "The saving will come from keeping the total dimension lost on decreasing" (paper))
Striking feature: The strict inequality $s<Wm$: the edges need fewer smaller calls than wires times dimension, which is the whole source of the power saving. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- A schedule that first subtracts the effect of the old scratch values, then adds the source effect, then undoes the scratch updates, has a net effect independent of the arbitrary initial scratch contents. (on [Restoring arbitrary scratch values](scratch-restoration.md))
- A forward invocation of the three-subset gather/scatter/side-wire construction adds $x_S$ to $y_S$ and leaves every other value unchanged. (on [Three-element subset construction](subset-construction.md))
- Forward, inverse and forward invocations along the three tensor coordinates send $(X_a,Y_a)$ to $(-Y_a,X_a)$ and restore every auxiliary wire. (on [Three-stage bank exchange](bank-exchange.md))
- Because a common frame commutes with a pointwise linear gate, the network on arrays implements $D_{\rm out}\mathsf S_\Omega D_{\rm in}^{-1}$ and the intermediate frames cancel. (on [Frames and the common-frame identity](frames.md))
- Labelling gates and terminals by nested nondegenerate subspaces of an $m$-dimensional bilinear space, the only decreasing edges are the central-wire returns, and the absolute label changes sum to $Wm-2N+2L$. (on [Subspace labels and orthogonal residuals](subspace-labels.md))
- With projection frames on the labels, the XOR bit network applies the shear $H\gets H+D$ on every role, with total edge rank $s_{\rm b}<W_{\rm b}m$. (on [Rational matrix interface of the bit network](bit-network-interface.md))
- With binary phase frames, the complex network needs $s_{\rm c}<W_{\rm c}m$ translation kernels and, after endpoint corrections, applies $C^{\otimes m}$ on every role. (on [Binary phase interface of the complex network](binary-phase-interface.md))
- Both relative deficits exceed $20\cdot2^{-50}$, so $s/W<m^{\tau}$ with $\tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50}$ for both networks. (on [Explicit exponents τ and σ](motif-exponents.md))

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine computes the exact $2n$-bit product of two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in that model.; how: build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) from finite linear networks with a rank deficit, assemble them into the transform-based convolution algorithm, prove exact recovery and bound the total time (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Subspace labels and orthogonal residuals](subspace-labels.md): Each gate and terminal is labelled by a nondegenerate subspace of a fixed m-dimensional bilinear space, adjacent labels are nested, and the dimension of the orthogonal residual on an edge counts the smaller operations that edge needs.
  Shown as: Rank deficit s < Wm *<predicate>* Subspace labels and orthogonal residuals

## Pages that build on this one

- Volume-normalized recursion: Dividing cost by data volume, a call at parameter mf makes s calls at parameter f each on volume V/W, so the normalized cost grows by s/W < m per factor m, giving cost O(V·f^τ) with τ < 1.
- Rational matrix interface of the bit network: Assigning projection matrices onto the labels as shear frames makes the XOR bit network apply the shear H ← H + D on every role, with total edge rank s_b < W_b·m.
- Explicit exponents τ and σ: The fixed rational exponents τ = σ = 1 − 2⁻⁵⁰ for the address and butterfly recurrences, justified because both relative rank deficits exceed 20·2⁻⁵⁰.
- Binary phase interface of the complex network: With phase frames on the complex network, s_c translation kernels in total suffice, and after endpoint diagonal corrections and undoing the bank exchange the network applies C^⊗m on every role.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$." (paper)

  > The finite construction in Section~\ref{sec:finite-networks} attaches subspaces of a fixed $m$-dimensional space to its gates and terminals. The subspaces at adjacent vertices are nested. Their dimension changes count the smaller operations needed on an edge, with an additional source contribution in the bit construction. The construction uses three-element subsets: gather and scatter create coefficients depending on intersection size, and auxiliary wires cancel the unwanted coefficients. Orthogonality of the corresponding indicator vectors permits the subspace assignments. The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.

- "In particular, both are smaller than $1/2$." (paper)

  > The loss ratios have the exact values \[ \frac{L_{\rm b}}{N}=\frac{100}{539},\qquad \frac{L_{\rm c}}{N}=\frac{101}{539}. \] In particular, both are smaller than $1/2$. We now turn the dimension count into the two interfaces needed later.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-rank-deficit.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-rank-deficit.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0023-write-rank-deficit` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-rank-deficit`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
