# exegenius task 0029-write-matrix-shear

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/Q1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, binomial counting, permutations, induction, graphs, the union bound, and elementary number theory with gcd, primes, modular inverses and the Chinese remainder theorem), an algorithms course (asymptotic notation, recurrences and geometric sums, divide and conquer including Karatsuba, sorting including radix sort, stacks, amortized counters, the RAM model and worst-case running time), and an introductory theory course with Turing machines and multitape tapes. From computer organization they know binary and two's-complement encodings, bit order, XOR and binary arithmetic; from calculus and a first linear-algebra course they know logarithms, exponentials, Newton's method, simple inequalities, complex numbers with conjugates, polynomials, matrices, Gaussian elimination, rank, dot products, projections and eigenvalues over the real or rational numbers.

## This page

Concept: Matrix shear by rank-many interchanges
Gloss: A shear (H, D) ↦ (H + AD, D) by a fixed rational matrix A of rank a is performed with exactly a smaller field interchanges plus O(V) triangular controlled shifts.

## This page in the argument

The step: For a fixed rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$, the shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ takes exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ work.
How: Factor $A=E_1\Pi E_2$ with lower triangular $E_1,E_2$, apply the triangular factors by controlled shifts, and realize each one of $\Pi$ by add, interchange, subtract.
Why: Controlled shifts update a later field from earlier ones in linear time, and lower triangular coordinate changes only ever need that direction, so only the $a$ ones of $\Pi$ need a costly interchange. (the sources say so: "updates a later field using
earlier fields in linear time.  Lower triangular changes of coordinates
can be performed entirely in this direction." (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Every rational $m\times m$ matrix of rank $a$ factors as $E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ a partial permutation with exactly $a$ ones.
- A lower triangular transformation of $H$ or of $D$ costs $O(V)$ by updating coordinates in descending physical order.
- Each one of $\Pi$ is realized as $D_j\gets D_j+H_i$, $(H_i,D_j)\gets(D_j,H_i)$, $D_j\gets H_i-D_j$, using a single interchange.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine computes the exact $2n$-bit product of two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to radix-digit convolution, move it by a Chinese-remainder map, Gaussian resampling, chirps and a phase twist to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ computed by synthetic transforms; speed up the transforms' address movement and butterfly layers with two network-based tape procedures; then prove exact recovery and total the costs. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures save over plain scanning: address chunks of width $u$ are interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time, and a simultaneous normalized butterfly layer on $D\le d$ chunks costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with fixed $\tau,\lambda'<1$.; how: Build each procedure from its own fixed linear network that exchanges two banks and restores scratch wires, apply the network pointwise to row-split role streams with frames chosen so every edge is a few smaller calls, and solve the volume-normalized recurrence.
- The fast address-chunk interchange: one fixed procedure interchanges two disjoint $u$-bit address fields of any array in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time with $\tau=1-2^{-50}$.; how: Prove the power-width case with enough rows first, then supply rows from the top digits of the chunks, split a general width into base-$m$ pieces, and pad binary chunks to radix-$q$ ranges. (on [Fast address-chunk interchange](chunk-swap.md))
- For $e=m^k$, two disjoint chunks of $e$ radix-$q$ digits, preceded by a row field whose length is divisible by $W^k$, can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time on fixed tapes.; how: Split rows cyclically among the $W$ roles of the bit network, use shear frames $\Phi_M$ so the network computes $H\gets H+D$ on every role, implement each edge by recursive smaller interchanges, finish the interchange with two linear updates, and solve the volume-normalized recurrence. (on [Power-width interchange](power-width-interchange.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S2.1.3.1, S2.1.3.2, S2.1.3.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S2.1.3.1**: Every rational $m\times m$ matrix of rank $a$ factors as $E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ a partial permutation with exactly $a$ ones.
Source: "Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[Lower triangular factorization] \label{lem:lower-lower} Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization \[ A=E_1\Pi E_2, \] where $E_1,E_2$ are invertible lower triangular rational matrices and $\Pi$ has exactly $a$ entries equal to one, with at most one in each row and column, and all remaining entries zero. \end{lemma}

**S2.1.3.2**: A lower triangular transformation of $H$ or of $D$ costs $O(V)$ by updating coordinates in descending physical order.
Source: "A lower triangular transformation of $H$, or of $D$, costs $O(V)$:
update coordinates in descending physical order." (paper)
> A lower triangular transformation of $H$, or of $D$, costs $O(V)$: update coordinates in descending physical order. At coordinate $i$, multiply by its diagonal unit and add a fixed linear combination of earlier coordinates. These earlier coordinates still have their original values. Apply Lemma~\ref{lem:ordered-affine-streams}; the number of coordinates is the fixed number $m$. Inverses are also lower triangular.

**S2.1.3.3**: Each one of $\Pi$ is realized as $D_j\gets D_j+H_i$, $(H_i,D_j)\gets(D_j,H_i)$, $D_j\gets H_i-D_j$, using a single interchange.
Source: "On an initial pair $(h,d)$ this sequence yields $(h+d,d)$.
It uses just one interchange." (paper)
> For $A=E_1\Pi E_2$, first transform $D$ by $E_2$ and $H$ by $E_1^{-1}$, then add $\Pi D$ to $H$, and finally transform $H$ by $E_1$ and $D$ by $E_2^{-1}$. Each one in position $(i,j)$ of $\Pi$ calls for $H_i\leftarrow H_i+D_j$. Implement it by \[ D_j\leftarrow D_j+H_i,\qquad (H_i,D_j)\leftarrow(D_j,H_i),\qquad D_j\leftarrow H_i-D_j. \] The first and last updates target a later field controlled by an earlier field. On an initial pair $(h,d)$ this sequence yields $(h+d,d)$. It uses just one interchange. There are $a$ ones, which proves the claim. In particular, the number of recursive calls is the rational rank $a$; temporary tapes used for the other operations do not multiply that count. \end{proof}

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work." (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[The cost of a rational matrix shear] \label{lem:matrix-shear} Let $\mathcal A$ be a fixed finite collection of rational $m\times m$ matrices. There is a fixed odd prime $q$ such that the following holds. Let $H=(H_1,\ldots,H_m)$ and $D=(D_1,\ldots,D_m)$ be two ordered groups of fields, every field ranging over $[q^b]$, with every $H_i$ before every $D_j$. For $A\in\mathcal A$ of rational rank $a$, the permutation \[ (H,D)\longmapsto(H+AD,D) \quad\text{over }\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z \] can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work. Every interchange is between an $H$ field and a $D$ field. Spectators between any of the formal fields are allowed. \end{lemma}

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0029-write-matrix-shear`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
