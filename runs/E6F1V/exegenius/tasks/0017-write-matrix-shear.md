# exegenius task 0017-write-matrix-shear

Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F1V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Rational matrix shear as field interchanges
Gloss: The map (H,D)→(H+AD,D) over Z/q^b for a rank-a rational matrix A is performed by triangular controlled shifts and exactly a interchanges of b-digit fields.

## This page in the argument

The step: The shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ for a rank-$a$ rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ costs exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ work.
How: Conjugate the partial permutation $\Pi$ by lower-triangular controlled shifts and turn each of its $a$ ones into one field interchange.
Why: Lower-triangular updates target later fields from earlier ones and so are linear time; only the ones of $\Pi$ need real interchanges, which is why the number of recursive calls is the rank. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- A lower triangular transformation of the $H$ or $D$ fields costs $O(V)$, updating coordinates in descending physical order.
- For $A=E_1\Pi E_2$: transform $D$ by $E_2$ and $H$ by $E_1^{-1}$, add $\Pi D$ to $H$, then transform $H$ by $E_1$ and $D$ by $E_2^{-1}$.
- Each one of $\Pi$ calls for $H_i\leftarrow H_i+D_j$, done with two linear updates and one interchange, so there are $a$ interchanges in all.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- There is one deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine multiplying $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce the product to a digit convolution computed with Fourier-type transforms on power-of-two axes, and accelerate the transforms' address rearrangements and butterfly layers by a power of the logarithm. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- There are two fixed-tape procedures whose cost beats a full scan per level by a power: an address-chunk interchange in $O(Vu^\tau)$ and a simultaneous butterfly layer in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$.; how: Build each procedure from a fixed linear network that exchanges two banks of values and restores its scratch values, and apply it recursively with a strict rank deficit.
- Two disjoint address chunks of $u$ bits, with any prefix, gap and suffix, can be interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ tape steps for a fixed $\tau<1$.; how: Move the top digits of both chunks into a row field, pad rows to a multiple of $W^k$, write the remaining width in base $m$ and apply the power-width interchange to each base-$m$ piece. (on [Fast interchange of address chunks](chunk-interchange.md))
- Two chunks of $e=m^k$ digits can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time by running a fixed exchange network of $W$ wires whose edges are smaller interchanges, with $s<Wm$ smaller calls in all.; how: Exchange the chunks with a shear $H\leftarrow H+D$ run through the bit network on $W$ role streams of volume $V/W$, implement each edge by smaller interchanges, and solve the recursion. (on [Power-width address interchange with rows](power-interchange.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (KEY.3.1, KEY.3.2, KEY.3.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**KEY.3.1**: A lower triangular transformation of the $H$ or $D$ fields costs $O(V)$, updating coordinates in descending physical order.
Source: "A lower triangular transformation of $H$, or of $D$, costs $O(V)$:" (paper)
> A lower triangular transformation of $H$, or of $D$, costs $O(V)$: update coordinates in descending physical order. At coordinate $i$, multiply by its diagonal unit and add a fixed linear combination of earlier coordinates. These earlier coordinates still have their original values. Apply Lemma~\ref{lem:ordered-affine-streams}; the number of coordinates is the fixed number $m$. Inverses are also lower triangular.

**KEY.3.2**: For $A=E_1\Pi E_2$: transform $D$ by $E_2$ and $H$ by $E_1^{-1}$, add $\Pi D$ to $H$, then transform $H$ by $E_1$ and $D$ by $E_2^{-1}$.
Source: "For $A=E_1\Pi E_2$, first transform $D$ by $E_2$ and $H$ by $E_1^{-1}$," (paper)
> For $A=E_1\Pi E_2$, first transform $D$ by $E_2$ and $H$ by $E_1^{-1}$, then add $\Pi D$ to $H$, and finally transform $H$ by $E_1$ and $D$ by $E_2^{-1}$. Each one in position $(i,j)$ of $\Pi$ calls for $H_i\leftarrow H_i+D_j$. Implement it by \[ D_j\leftarrow D_j+H_i,\qquad (H_i,D_j)\leftarrow(D_j,H_i),\qquad D_j\leftarrow H_i-D_j. \] The first and last updates target a later field controlled by an earlier field. On an initial pair $(h,d)$ this sequence yields $(h+d,d)$. It uses just one interchange. There are $a$ ones, which proves the claim. In particular, the number of recursive calls is the rational rank $a$; temporary tapes used for the other operations do not multiply that count. \end{proof}

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The cost of a rational matrix shear" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[The cost of a rational matrix shear] \label{lem:matrix-shear} Let $\mathcal A$ be a fixed finite collection of rational $m\times m$ matrices. There is a fixed odd prime $q$ such that the following holds. Let $H=(H_1,\ldots,H_m)$ and $D=(D_1,\ldots,D_m)$ be two ordered groups of fields, every field ranging over $[q^b]$, with every $H_i$ before every $D_j$. For $A\in\mathcal A$ of rational rank $a$, the permutation \[ (H,D)\longmapsto(H+AD,D) \quad\text{over }\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z \] can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work. Every interchange is between an $H$ field and a $D$ field. Spectators between any of the formal fields are allowed. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-matrix-shear.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-matrix-shear.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0017-write-matrix-shear` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0017-write-matrix-shear`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
