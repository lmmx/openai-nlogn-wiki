# exegenius task 0445-audit-scratch-storage

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Scratch storage

Scratch storage is auxiliary storage that a procedure may overwrite during its work but must restore to its starting contents, whatever those contents were. The side and central wires of the [subset-intersection network](subset-intersection-network.md) are scratch storage that is restored by that network. The address-field interchange, which swaps two address fields, and the packed selected-bit addition, which adds a bit position across address chunks, both depend on it.

A tape machine reuses its work space, so scratch wires may hold old values. The paper therefore states: In the bit construction,

Several letters below change meaning here, since earlier pages use them otherwise. The letters $S$ and $T$ denote triples, three-element subsets of the ground set, and two triples are neighbours when they share exactly one element. Write $x$ for the control vector, with entries $x_T$, and $y$ for the target vector, with entries $y_S$. Each neighbouring pair $(S,T)$ has a side wire $W_{ST}$, and each element $\ell$ of the ground set has a central wire $C_\ell$. Write $a$ for the starting values of the side wires and $c$ for those of the central wires.

$V$ is copy, which adds $x_T$ to $W_{ST}$. $J$ is side injection, which adds to $y_S$ the side wires $W_{ST}$ over the neighbours $T$ of $S$. $G$ is gather, which adds $x_T$ to each $C_\ell$ with $\ell\in T$. $R$ is scatter, which adds to $y_S$ the central wires $C_\ell$ with $\ell\in S$.

The eight-row forward schedule starts with rows 0 and 1, which subtract $Ja+Rc$ from the target $y$, cancelling the effect of the starting values. Rows 2 and 3 copy and gather, so the side wires hold $a+Vx$ and the central wires hold $c+Gx$. Rows 4 and 5 scatter and side-inject these into the target. Rows 6 and 7 undo gather and copy.

Adding the rows gives $-Ja-Rc+R(c+Gx)+J(a+Vx)$. The terms in $a$ and $c$ cancel, leaving $(JV+RG)x$. The paper's count:

The coefficient of $x_T$ in $RG$ at $y_S$ is $|S\cap T| \bmod 2$, as $x_T$ reaches $y_S$ once per element of $S\cap T$. In $JV$ it is 1 exactly when $|S\cap T|=1$. Their sum mod 2 is 1 for $T=S$ and 0 otherwise, so $JV+RG$ is the identity: $y_S+x_S$ and

Worked example. In a toy with no side wires, $R$ reads one central wire $C_\ell$ for $y_S$, and $G$ adds 3 to $C_\ell$. If $c=7$, row 1 subtracts 7, row 3 makes $C_\ell=10$, row 4 adds 10, and row 6 restores $C_\ell$ to 7: the net change is $-7+10=3$. If $c=0$, the net change is again 3.

On arrays, gates act pointwise:. Scratch storage restores values at every address of the [address field](address-field.md) it occupies.

It is a linear version of a construction by Buhrman, Cleve, Koucký, Loff and Speelman:
