Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F6B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Cost table and exponent margins
Gloss: Dividing each phase's cost by Tp = Θ(n) gives seven dominant powers of p, each at most 1−2κ for the fixed rational exponents, so the total is O(n (log n)^(1−κ)).

## This page in the argument

The step: Dividing each phase's cost by $Tp=\Theta(n)$ gives seven dominant powers of $p$, each at most $1-2\kappa$ for the fixed rational exponents, so the total is $O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$.
How: Tabulate the normalized cost of each phase, read off the exponent of $p$ of each dominant row, compare each with one using the fixed rational parameters, and absorb remaining powers of $\log p$.
Why: Every phase handles $Tp=\Theta(n)$ stored bits, so cost per bit is a power of $p=\Theta(\log n)$, and the total is $n$ times that power of the logarithm. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- After division by $V=Tp$, the phases cost $dK$, $pK^{\tau-1}$, $\ell d^{\lambda'}$, $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$, $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$, $dp^{\delta}$ and $\log(rp)$, with all remaining phases absorbed.
- The seven margins $g_i$ below one satisfy $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$ for the fixed rational parameters.
- Each of the seven powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, so the total cost is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Provide two fast tape procedures, place them inside the Gaussian-resampling and synthetic-transform reduction of the integer product to a convolution, then check precision and exact recovery and add up the costs of all phases.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S6.1, S6.2, S6.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S6.1**: After division by $V=Tp$, the phases cost $dK$, $pK^{\tau-1}$, $\ell d^{\lambda'}$, $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$, $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$, $dp^{\delta}$ and $\log(rp)$, with all remaining phases absorbed.
Source: "For the cost calculation put $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$. The fixed-width coefficient" (paper)
> For the cost calculation put $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$. The fixed-width coefficient formats use $\Theta(p)$ bits per coefficient, so a full padded array has $\Theta(V)$ stored bits. Table~\ref{tab:costs} lists costs after division by $V$; a fixed number of repeated transforms and convolutions is included in its constants. \begin{table}[ht] \centering \small \begin{tabular}{@{}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{.40\linewidth}ll@{}} \toprule Operation & Normalized cost & Power of $p$\\ \midrule Prefix-slot moves and individual butterfly rounds & $dK$ & $\epsilon(1+c)$\\ Chunk exchanges for transform layout & $pK^{\tau-1}$ & $1-\epsilon c(1-\tau)$\\ Simultaneous butterfly rounds & $\ell d^{\lambda'}$ & $1-\epsilon(1-\lambda')$\\ CRT and axis layouts & $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$ & $\tau+\epsilon(2-\tau)$\\ Gaussian line maps & $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$ & $3/4+\delta+3\epsilon/2$\\ Chirps, twists and scalar products & $dp^\delta$ & $\epsilon+\delta$\\ Packed polynomial products & $\log(rp)$ & $1-\epsilon$\\ Final scaling and rounding & $p^\delta$ & absorbed above\\ Input, padding, carries and output & $1$ & absorbed above\\ \bottomrule \end{tabular} \caption{Costs divided by $Tp$; each coefficient representation has $O(p)$ bits.}\label{tab:costs} \end{table}

**S6.2**: The seven margins $g_i$ below one satisfy $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$ for the fixed rational parameters.
Source: "Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.  This explicit slack will cover" (paper)
> The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

**S6.3**: Each of the seven powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, so the total cost is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$.
Source: "Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by" (paper)
> Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by \eqref{eq:margin-list}. Any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually. The complete large-input bound is consequently \[ O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}). \] Fix one cutoff beyond all the size, precision, margin and layout conditions, and use schoolbook multiplication below it. The finitely many smaller lengths are included by enlarging the implicit constant. With $\lg n=\max\{\lceil\log_2n\rceil,1\}$, the resulting single fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape deterministic machine has worst-case time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every input length and produces precisely the required $2n$-bit product. \section{Exact division and integer square root} \label{sec:exact-arithmetic-proof}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-time-bound-accounting.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-time-bound-accounting.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0039-write-time-bound-accounting` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-time-bound-accounting`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
