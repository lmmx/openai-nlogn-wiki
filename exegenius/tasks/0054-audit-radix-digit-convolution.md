# exegenius task 0054-audit-radix-digit-convolution

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is an undergraduate computer scientist who has studied discrete mathematics (integers, modular arithmetic, gcd and primes at the basic level, sets, bijections, binomial coefficients), undergraduate linear algebra (vector spaces, matrices, rank, Gaussian elimination, dot products, norms), the single-variable calculus a CS degree requires (limits, convergence of sequences and series, basic integrals, logarithms and exponentials), algorithms and complexity (big-O together with Omega and Theta, recurrences, schoolbook multiplication, worst-case running time of Turing machines), and binary arithmetic with basic complex numbers. This covers the sources' integer, bit, linear-algebra, limit and asymptotic bookkeeping, but not prime-number density results, tensor products, operator norms and contractions, Gaussian integers, or the quotient-ring and Fourier machinery beyond the existing concepts.

# Radix-digit convolution

Radix-digit convolution rewrites the product of two $n$-bit integers as a product of two polynomials with small nonnegative coefficients, which is the first step toward computing integer products on a fixed-tape machine.

Fix a digit width $b$, the number of bits in each radix digit. Let $m = \lceil n/b \rceil$ be the number of digits in each input. The digit $u_i$, for $0 \le i \le m-1$, is the $i$-th radix digit of the first input, and $v_i$ is the $i$-th radix digit of the second input, each in $\{0,\dots,2^b-1\}$. Let $t$ be a formal variable. The polynomial $U(t)$ has the digits of the first input as coefficients. The polynomial $V(t)$ has the digits of the second input as coefficients, so that $U(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} u_i t^i$ and $V(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} v_i t^i$.

Evaluating at $t = 2^b$ recovers the inputs, since $U(2^b) = \sum_i u_i 2^{bi}$, and evaluation respects products. The product of the inputs is therefore $U(2^b)V(2^b) = W(2^b)$, where the product polynomial is $W(t) = U(t)V(t)$. Its $k$-th coefficient $w_k$ is the sum of $u_i v_j$ over $i+j=k$, which is a convolution of the two digit lists.

Each $w_k$ is a sum of at most $m$ products $u_i v_j$, each below $2^{2b}$, so $0 \le w_k < m\,2^{2b}$. The coefficients are therefore short nonnegative integers whose bound depends only on $b$ and $m$.

Computing $W$ from the two digit lists is a [Cyclic convolution](cyclic-convolution.md) of length at least $2m-1$ with zero padding, so the integer product is reduced to a cyclic convolution.

For example, take $b = 4$ and $n = 8$, so $m = 2$. The integers $75 = 11 + 4\cdot 16$ and $38 = 6 + 2\cdot 16$ give $U(t) = 11 + 4t$ and $V(t) = 6 + 2t$, so $W(t) = 66 + 46t + 8t^2$. At $t = 16$ this gives $66 + 736 + 2048 = 2850 = 75 \cdot 38$, and every coefficient lies below $m\,2^{2b} = 512$.

The point of the reduction is that a convolution of short coefficients can be computed by transforms, and the carries are handled afterwards by [Exact recovery by rounding and carries](exact-recovery.md).
