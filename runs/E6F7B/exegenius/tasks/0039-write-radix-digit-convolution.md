Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F7B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, functions, permutations, modular arithmetic, primes and gcd), calculus-level analysis (limits, sums, Newton's method), first-course linear algebra (matrices, inverses, Gaussian elimination, vectors) and complex numbers up to roots of unity, algorithm analysis (recursion, recurrences, big-O with its relatives Omega, Theta, little-o) and basic Turing machines.

Concept: Integer multiplication as radix-digit convolution
Gloss: Splitting each n-bit input into radix-2^b digits turns the product into a convolution of short digit polynomials, padded so that no cyclic wraparound occurs, followed by a left-to-right carry propagation that yields the 2n-bit product.

## This page in the argument

The step: Splitting each input into radix-$2^b$ digits gives a digit polynomial product of degree below $S$, so convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no wraparound and every coefficient is below $2^{3b}$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Keep the transform-based multiplication of Harvey and van der Hoeven (Gaussian resampling, Bluestein chirp, synthetic polynomial transforms) but replace its two costly tape operations, address rearrangement and butterfly layers, by faster procedures obtained from rank-saving linear networks, then check exactness and total cost. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The algorithm of digit extraction, address map to prime axes, two source transforms, truncated pointwise product, opposite-sign transform, rescaling by $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$, rounding, inverse address map and carries produces the exact $2n$-bit product.; how: Turn the product into a radix-digit convolution, place it on prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map, compute the convolution through the three source transforms, and prove that rounding recovers the integer coefficients. (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Cyclic convolution and the convolution theorem](cyclic-convolution.md): The product of two polynomials modulo x^q − 1 (indices added mod q); the Fourier transform turns it into a pointwise product, so convolution = transform, multiply pointwise, inverse transform.
  Shown as: Integer multiplication as radix-digit convolution *<predicate>* Cyclic convolution and the convolution theorem

## Pages that build on this one

- Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes: For pairwise coprime lengths s_i with product S, the algebra isomorphism x ↦ Π x_i^{μ_i} turns one cyclic convolution of length S into a multidimensional cyclic convolution on prime axes; on tape it is a sequence of prefix-controlled cyclic shifts.
- Precision budget and exact recovery: Scale bookkeeping (the two factors S) and the error bound 448 b 2^{−b+γ} < 1/2 show that each recovered convolution coefficient rounds to the true integer, which is below 2^{3b}, so carries give the exact product.
- The multiplication algorithm: Digit extraction, the address map Φ to prime axes, two source transforms, a truncated pointwise product, the opposite-sign transform, rescaling by S and 2^{2b+4}, rounding, inverse address map and carry propagation, producing the 2n-bit product.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Write the two inputs as polynomials in $2^b$, each with" (paper)

  > Write the two inputs as polynomials in $2^b$, each with $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ nonnegative digits. Their product has degree at most \[ 2q-2<2n/b\le T/2<S. \] Thus convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no nonzero wraparound. Every product coefficient obeys \begin{equation}\label{eq:capacity} 0\le c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2<2^{3b}, \end{equation} since $q\le n\le2^b$.

- "Thus convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no nonzero wraparound." (paper)

  > Write the two inputs as polynomials in $2^b$, each with $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ nonnegative digits. Their product has degree at most \[ 2q-2<2n/b\le T/2<S. \] Thus convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no nonzero wraparound. Every product coefficient obeys \begin{equation}\label{eq:capacity} 0\le c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2<2^{3b}, \end{equation} since $q\le n\le2^b$.

- "k_0=0,\qquad d_j=(c_j+k_j)\bmod Q_0," (paper)

  > To propagate carries, let $Q_0=2^b$. The recovered ordinary coefficients are the $c_j$ in \eqref{eq:capacity}; they are zero for $2q-2<j<S$. With $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ as above, use the recurrence for $0\le j<S$: \[ k_0=0,\qquad d_j=(c_j+k_j)\bmod Q_0,\qquad k_{j+1}=\left\lfloor\frac{c_j+k_j}{Q_0}\right\rfloor. \] The carries satisfy $0\le k_j\le q(Q_0-1)<Q_0^2$. If this holds at $j$, then \[ c_j+k_j\le q(Q_0-1)^2+q(Q_0-1)=qQ_0(Q_0-1), \] which proves the next carry bound. The defining relation $c_j+k_j=d_j+Q_0k_{j+1}$ also gives the exact invariant \[ \sum_{h<j}c_hQ_0^h =\sum_{h<j}d_hQ_0^h+k_jQ_0^j. \] It holds for $j=0$, and the defining relation proves its next instance. The unprocessed terms are multiples of $Q_0^j$, so the identity fixes the first $j$ radix digits of the full product. The value $k_j$ is the carry from the processed coefficients into the remaining positions.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-radix-digit-convolution.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-radix-digit-convolution.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0039-write-radix-digit-convolution` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-radix-digit-convolution`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
