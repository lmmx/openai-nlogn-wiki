# exegenius task 0024-write-matrix-shear

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

## This page

Concept: Matrix shears and triangular factorization
Gloss: The address map (H,D) → (H+AD,D) for a rational matrix A of rank a is done with exactly a field interchanges plus linear-cost triangular updates, using the factorization A = E₁ΠE₂ with E₁,E₂ lower triangular.

## This page in the argument

The step: The address map $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ for a rational matrix $A$ of rank $a$ is done with exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work.
How: Factor $A=E_1\Pi E_2$ with lower triangular $E_1,E_2$, do the triangular parts as linear-cost controlled shifts, and spend one interchange per entry of $\Pi$.
Why: Lower triangular coordinate changes update a later field from earlier ones, which is exactly the direction in which controlled shifts run in linear time. (the sources say so: "can be performed entirely in this direction." (paper))
Striking feature: The cost of the shear is its rank $a$, not its size: the triangular factors are free, so only the pivots of the partial permutation cost recursive interchanges. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ factors as $A=E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ a partial permutation matrix with exactly $a$ ones.
- Conjugating by the triangular factors, which are controlled shifts of linear cost, leaves one field interchange per one in $\Pi$, so the shear costs exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of radix digits, evaluate it with Fourier-type transforms whose data movement and butterfly layers are accelerated by two power-saving tape procedures, recover the exact integers by rounding and carries, and add up the costs. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two disjoint address chunks of $u$ bits each in an array of bit volume $V$ can be interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time for a fixed $\tau<1$, although the intermediate steps form XOR combinations of the data.; how: Realize the shear $H\leftarrow H+D$ by a fixed bit network of pointwise XOR gates with scratch wires and nested subspace labels, perform each edge by smaller interchanges on role streams, and solve the resulting recurrence. (on [Fast address chunk interchange](address-interchange.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.6.1, S1.6.2). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.6.1**: Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ factors as $A=E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ a partial permutation matrix with exactly $a$ ones.
Source: "Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[Lower triangular factorization] \label{lem:lower-lower} Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization \[ A=E_1\Pi E_2, \] where $E_1,E_2$ are invertible lower triangular rational matrices and $\Pi$ has exactly $a$ entries equal to one, with at most one in each row and column, and all remaining entries zero. \end{lemma}

**S1.6.2**: Conjugating by the triangular factors, which are controlled shifts of linear cost, leaves one field interchange per one in $\Pi$, so the shear costs exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$.
Source: "can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[The cost of a rational matrix shear] \label{lem:matrix-shear} Let $\mathcal A$ be a fixed finite collection of rational $m\times m$ matrices. There is a fixed odd prime $q$ such that the following holds. Let $H=(H_1,\ldots,H_m)$ and $D=(D_1,\ldots,D_m)$ be two ordered groups of fields, every field ranging over $[q^b]$, with every $H_i$ before every $D_j$. For $A\in\mathcal A$ of rational rank $a$, the permutation \[ (H,D)\longmapsto(H+AD,D) \quad\text{over }\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z \] can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work. Every interchange is between an $H$ field and a $D$ field. Spectators between any of the formal fields are allowed. \end{lemma}

- [Controlled cyclic shifts of an address field](controlled-shifts.md): Updating a target field y mod q^b by an offset computed from earlier control fields, or multiplying it by a unit, costs O(V) on tape by splitting each fiber at the offset and merging the pieces swapped.

## Pages that build on this one

- Recursion with a strict rank saving: Each call at parameter mf makes s calls at parameter f on streams of volume V/W, so the normalized cost obeys F_k ≤ (s/W)F_{k−1} + O(1) and, because s/W < m, grows like m^{kτ} with τ < 1.
- Fast address chunk interchange: Two disjoint equal-width address chunks of u bits are exchanged in O(V u^τ) time for a fixed τ < 1 by computing XOR combinations of intermediate streams through the bit network, even though the net effect is an exact permutation.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-matrix-shear.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-matrix-shear.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0024-write-matrix-shear` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-matrix-shear`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
