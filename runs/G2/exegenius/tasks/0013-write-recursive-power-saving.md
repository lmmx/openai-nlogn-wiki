# exegenius task 0013-write-recursive-power-saving

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

For these sources: Undergraduate computer science: algorithms and complexity through big-O analysis, recurrences and divide-and-conquer (Karatsuba, FFT-based polynomial multiplication, usually met at the level of the standard recursive FFT), discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes and gcd, sets, functions and permutations, induction), and introductory linear algebra (matrices, rank, bases, inner products, Gaussian elimination, over the reals and probably F_2).

## This page

Concept: Recursive power saving from the rank deficit
Gloss: A call at parameter m·f uses s calls at parameter f on streams of volume V/W, so cost per volume grows like m^τ rather than m, with τ<1 because s/W<m.

## This page in the argument

The step: For $e=m^k$ digits and a row field divisible by $W^k$, interchanging two chunks of $e$ digits costs $O(V e^\tau)$, because the shear $H\leftarrow H+D$ is made of $s$ calls on $e/m$ digits, each on a role stream of volume $V/W$, and $s/W<m^\tau$ with $\tau<1$.
How: Split the rows cyclically into $W$ role streams, run the network with address-shear frames so that each edge change becomes a smaller shear costing as many smaller interchanges as its rank, and solve the recurrence $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$ for the cost per unit volume by a geometric sum.
Why: Dividing cost by volume, each of the $s$ calls on $1/W$ of the volume contributes a factor $s/W$, so multiplying the parameter by $m$ increases the cost per volume by a factor less than $m$. (the sources say so: "After dividing cost by volume, multiplying the parameter by $m$" (paper))
Striking feature: The inequality $s/W<m$ is strict, so the cost per volume grows like $m^\tau$ with $\tau<1$ rather than like $m$; a non-strict inequality would give only linear cost. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Splitting whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix gives streams of identical shape, each of logical volume $V/W$.
- Taking as the frame at a vertex of matrix $M$ the address permutation $\Phi_M:(H,D)\mapsto(H+MD,D)$, each edge applies $\Phi_{A_e}$ as a smaller shear, gates act pointwise, and the endpoint condition $M_{{\rm out}(\rho(w))}-M_{{\rm in}(w)}=I_m$ yields $H\leftarrow H+D$ on every row, scratch rows included.
- The interchange of the two full chunks is $D\leftarrow D-H$, then $H\leftarrow H+D$, then $D\leftarrow H-D$; only the middle shear uses the network.
- The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$, each on one role stream of volume $V/W$.
- With $F_0=O(1)$ and $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$ for $s/W<m^\tau$, the geometric sum gives $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.
- A fixed-tape depth-first schedule parks the inactive role streams on a stack, so each node pays only an additional $O(V)$ and the recursion needs a fixed number of tapes.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution over a polynomial ring computed by Fourier-type transforms; supply the two fast tape procedures that remove the logarithmic factor from address movement and from butterfly arithmetic, both obtained from linear networks that save a power; then assemble the algorithm and tally every cost. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- For a fixed $\tau<1$, two disjoint contiguous address chunks of $u$ bits in an array of volume $V$ can be interchanged in $O(V u^\tau)$ time on a fixed number of tapes, although the intermediate streams are XOR combinations of the data.; how: Reduce the interchange to the shear $H\leftarrow H+D$ of the two chunks, perform that shear with the bit network by calls on smaller chunks over role streams of volume $V/W$, solve the resulting recurrence, and then remove the restrictions on width and number of rows. (on [Fast interchange of address chunks](fast-chunk-interchange.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S2.2.1, S2.2.2, S2.2.3, S2.2.4, S2.2.5, S2.2.6). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S2.2.1**: Splitting whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix gives streams of identical shape, each of logical volume $V/W$.
Source: "Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix" (paper)
> Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix preceding the row field. Write the original row number as $r=Wg+(w-1)$ with $1\le w\le W$; stream $w$ has row number $g$. These streams have exactly the same remaining shape, including the full ranges of $H$ and $D$. Each has logical volume $V/W$, and its row count is divisible by $W^{k-1}$.

**S2.2.2**: Taking as the frame at a vertex of matrix $M$ the address permutation $\Phi_M:(H,D)\mapsto(H+MD,D)$, each edge applies $\Phi_{A_e}$ as a smaller shear, gates act pointwise, and the endpoint condition $M_{{\rm out}(\rho(w))}-M_{{\rm in}(w)}=I_m$ yields $H\leftarrow H+D$ on every row, scratch rows included.
Source: "For a rational matrix $M$, let $\Phi_M$ act on an array by moving its" (paper)
> For a rational matrix $M$, let $\Phi_M$ act on an array by moving its entry at address $(H,D)$ to $(H+MD,D)$, with every spectator unchanged. Thus $\Phi_M$ is the array permutation induced by that address map. Its inverse is $\Phi_{-M}$ and $\Phi_{M'}\Phi_M=\Phi_{M'+M}$. On every circuit edge apply $\Phi_{A_e}$ to that role stream; implement it by Lemma~\ref{lem:matrix-shear}, recursively interchanging each pivot pair of $b$-digit fields. Execute each circuit gate pointwise at matching addresses of its role streams.

**S2.2.3**: The interchange of the two full chunks is $D\leftarrow D-H$, then $H\leftarrow H+D$, then $D\leftarrow H-D$; only the middle shear uses the network.
Source: "To interchange the two full chunks, perform" (paper)
> To interchange the two full chunks, perform \[ D\leftarrow D-H,\qquad H\leftarrow H+D,\qquad D\leftarrow H-D, \] componentwise. Only the middle shear uses the circuit. The other two updates target the later group and have linear cost. The transformation sends $(H,D)$ to $(D,H)$.

**S2.2.4**: The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$, each on one role stream of volume $V/W$.
Source: "The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$." (paper)
> The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$. Each acts on one role stream of volume $V/W$, retaining all other fields as spectators. Splitting, merging, gates, and triangular operations have total cost $O(V)$ because their number is fixed. Below we verify that scheduling the recursive calls on fixed tapes also costs $O(V)$ at this node. Thus if $F_k$ is a uniform upper bound for time divided by logical volume, then \begin{equation} \label{eq:swap-recurrence} F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1). \end{equation} For $a=s/W<m^\tau$ the geometric sum $\sum_{j=0}^k a^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$. If $a\le1$, the sum is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; if $a>1$, it is $O(a^k)$. Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.

**S2.2.5**: With $F_0=O(1)$ and $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$ for $s/W<m^\tau$, the geometric sum gives $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.
Source: "For $a=s/W<m^\tau$ the geometric sum" (paper)
> The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$. Each acts on one role stream of volume $V/W$, retaining all other fields as spectators. Splitting, merging, gates, and triangular operations have total cost $O(V)$ because their number is fixed. Below we verify that scheduling the recursive calls on fixed tapes also costs $O(V)$ at this node. Thus if $F_k$ is a uniform upper bound for time divided by logical volume, then \begin{equation} \label{eq:swap-recurrence} F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1). \end{equation} For $a=s/W<m^\tau$ the geometric sum $\sum_{j=0}^k a^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$. If $a\le1$, the sum is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; if $a>1$, it is $O(a^k)$. Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.

**S2.2.6**: A fixed-tape depth-first schedule parks the inactive role streams on a stack, so each node pays only an additional $O(V)$ and the recursion needs a fixed number of tapes.
Source: "Here we complete the implementation assertion used in" (paper)
> \paragraph{A fixed-tape depth-first schedule.} Here we complete the implementation assertion used in \eqref{eq:swap-recurrence}. Reserve $W$ role tapes, a fixed set of I/O and elementary-operation work tapes, one parking stack tape, and a separate descriptor stack. Although $W$ is large, it is fixed. At a call boundary all reusable work tapes, other than the current I/O and local descriptor, are empty and their heads are at their origins. The parking and descriptor heads are at the tops of their stacks.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "This strict inequality
is the source of the power saving." (paper)

  > A recursive call at parameter $mf$ therefore uses $s$ calls at parameter $f$, each on a stream of volume $V/W$. The parameter counts field digits for address interchange and selected axes for a numerical layer. After dividing cost by volume, multiplying the parameter by $m$ increases the recursive contribution by $s/W<m$. This strict inequality is the source of the power saving. The later tape and arithmetic estimates preserve it, including the work of changing numerical address coordinates. Those changes are implemented by whole-chunk moves and controlled shifts, followed by a deterministic correction of the explicitly identified exceptional addresses.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0013-write-recursive-power-saving.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0013-write-recursive-power-saving.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0013-write-recursive-power-saving` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0013-write-recursive-power-saving`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
