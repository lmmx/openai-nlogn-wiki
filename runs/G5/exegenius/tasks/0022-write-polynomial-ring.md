# exegenius task 0022-write-polynomial-ring

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G5` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has a standard undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (induction, sums, logarithms, floor and ceiling, functions and bijections, graphs and acyclic circuits), algorithms (divide and conquer, recurrences, sorting in O(n log n), grade-school multiplication and Karatsuba, Newton's method from calculus), and the basic theory of computation with Turing machines and tapes. They know complex numbers, roots of unity, polynomial arithmetic, modular arithmetic and elementary linear algebra, and have seen the FFT as an algorithm. They have not studied abstract algebra beyond modular arithmetic, number theory beyond gcd and inverses, numerical analysis of rounding errors, or any multiplication algorithm beyond the basic ones, so the wiki must explain the Fourier-transform machinery, the polynomial ring, the Harvey-van der Hoeven resampling and the linear-network constructions.

## This page

Concept: Polynomial ring modulo yʳ + 1
Gloss: Complex polynomials of degree below r with y^r = −1, so that multiplying by a power of y is a signed shift of the coefficient list; powers of y serve as roots of unity.
Also called: negacyclic ring
Heading: Polynomial ring modulo $y^r+1$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $y$ (ring variable): The formal variable of the polynomials, subject to the relation y^r = −1.
- $r$ (record length): The number of complex coefficients in one polynomial record, a power of two.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- The normalized cyclic convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$ of disk-grid arrays over $\mathcal R_r$ is computed with error below $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ in $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda\prime}+\log(rp)])$ time. (on [Convolution from the retained transform layout](ring-convolution.md))
- A forward synthetic transform of $M$ polynomial records, with error below $\sqrt2\,\ell 2^{-p}$, costs $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda\prime}])$ and leaves its output in a retained layout order that the opposite transform consumes. (on [Transform layout for parallel butterfly rounds](transform-layout.md))
- The butterfly $H_0$ applied at once to the same bit position of $D\le d$ address chunks of polynomial-record arrays, followed by one truncation, costs $O(Vd^{\lambda\prime})$ for a fixed $\lambda\prime<1$ instead of $D$ passes. (on [Simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md))
- Over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ with $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$, the normalized transforms $F_t^\mp$ satisfy $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$ and are computed by $\log_2 t$ levels of butterflies and signed shifts, so twiddle multiplications are exact. (on [Synthetic polynomial transform](synthetic-transform.md))
- Two disk-grid polynomials of the ring can be multiplied exactly, by signed Kronecker packing at $B_0=2^{4p}$ and four integer products of the established multiplier, in $O(rp\log(rp))$ time, returning $Q_p(fg/r)$. (on [Signed Kronecker packing of polynomial products](signed-packing.md))
- Multiplying coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k$ with $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$ turns convolution modulo $x^r-1$ into convolution modulo $y^r+1$ on the last axis, so the complex cyclic convolution is the synthetic one conjugated by phase twists at cost $O(Tp^{1+\delta})$. (on [Phase twist to a negacyclic wrap](coefficient-twist.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Phase twist to a negacyclic wrap: Multiplying coefficient k by ζ^k with ζ = e^{πi/r} turns convolution modulo x^r − 1 into convolution modulo y^r + 1 on the last axis, and untwisting restores the cyclic wrap.
- Signed Kronecker packing of polynomial products: Ring elements are evaluated at B₀ = 2^{4p} as signed integers, multiplied with the established multiplier, and unpacked by centered residues and carries, giving exact polynomial products.
- Simultaneous butterfly layer: The butterfly H₀ applied at once to the same bit position of up to d address chunks of polynomial-record arrays, computed via C^{⊗D} on the phase network, at cost O(V d^{λ'}) instead of d passes.
- Synthetic polynomial transform: A Fourier transform whose roots of unity are powers ω_t = y^{2r/t} of the ring variable, so twiddle multiplications are exact signed shifts and only butterflies cost arithmetic.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)" (paper)

  > For an integer $r\geq 2$ that is a power of two, put \[ \mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1),\qquad \left\|\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}z_k y^k\right\|_\infty =\max_{0\leq k<r}|z_k|. \] We always use representatives of degree less than $r$. Multiplication by $y^a$, for any integer $a$, permutes the coefficients and changes some signs; consequently it is an isometry for this norm. For arrays over $\mathcal R_r$, the same notation denotes the maximum over all coefficients in all entries. A disk array has norm at most one. A $p$-bit grid array has real and imaginary coefficient parts in $2^{-p}\mathbb Z$. For any array, let $Q_p$ truncate each real and imaginary coefficient part toward zero to this grid. Then \begin{equation} \|Q_p z-z\|_\infty<\sqrt2\,2^{-p},\qquad \|Q_p z\|_\infty\leq\|z\|_\infty. \label{eq:transform-truncate} \end{equation}

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-polynomial-ring.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-polynomial-ring.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0022-write-polynomial-ring` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-polynomial-ring`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
