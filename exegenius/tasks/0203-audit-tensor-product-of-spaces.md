# exegenius task 0203-audit-tensor-product-of-spaces

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file and the paper at `sources/paper.tex`: do not read other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Fidelity: also check that the page's mathematics is right, and report what is wrong even where this reader could follow it. For each claim that states a definition, a hypothesis, a step of a proof, a value or a conclusion, work out what it assumes and what it concludes, and check it against everything this task file gives: the page's definitions, its other claims and its quotations. Report as a `step` any claim that is false, inconsistent with another statement on the page, stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it, or missing a hypothesis it needs. Quote the claim, and say in the note what is wrong and what the correct statement is.

The source: the paper this page explains is at `sources/paper.tex` (LaTeX). For each such claim, also find the passage of the paper that states, defines or proves it (search the file for the claim's terms and symbols, then read the passage around each match) and compare: every hypothesis present, the same scope and quantifiers, the same constants, signs, exponents and inequality directions, a conclusion no stronger than the paper's, and the right result, lemma or author credited. Report any mismatch as a `step` in the same way, and give the paper's line number in the note.

What counts as an error: report a claim as wrong only if, as this page states it, it is false; inconsistent with the page; stated more strongly or more widely than what supports it; missing a hypothesis without which it is false; given a wrong value, sign, exponent, constant, quantifier or credit; or presented as following from something it does not follow from. Do not report a correct statement as wrong because it is informal, abbreviated or simplified, uses a word in the paper's own sense, or leaves a technical precondition to another page or to the paper. If the paper's own summary of the same step states it the same way, it is not an error.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is a computer science undergraduate: they have taken discrete mathematics, an algorithms course (asymptotics, divide and conquer, schoolbook and Karatsuba multiplication, sorting), a first linear algebra course (vector spaces, subspaces, dimension, rank, matrices as linear maps, inverses, triangular matrices, orthogonality, bilinear forms at a basic level), calculus, elementary number theory (primes, gcd, modular arithmetic) and basic machine-level binary representation (XOR, two's complement). They have seen Turing machines with tapes only at an introductory level.

# Tensor products of subspaces

The tensor product $E\otimes G$ of two finite-dimensional vector spaces $E$ and $G$ over the same field is a space of dimension $\dim E\cdot\dim G$ on which operators and bilinear forms of the two factors act factorwise. It builds the gate label space from three copies of one small space.

Let $(\mathbf e_i)$ be a basis of $E$ and $(\mathbf g_j)$ a basis of $G$. The space $E\otimes G$ has as basis the symbols $\mathbf e_i\otimes\mathbf g_j$, one for each pair, so its dimension is $\dim E\cdot\dim G$. For $\xi\in E$ and $\eta\in G$, the pure tensor $\xi\otimes\eta$ is defined by expanding bilinearly. If $E$ and $G$ both have dimension $2$, an element of $E\otimes G$ is a $2\times2$ array and $\xi\otimes\eta$ has entries $\xi_i\eta_j$; $\mathbf e_1\otimes\mathbf g_1+\mathbf e_2\otimes\mathbf g_2$ is not a pure tensor.

**Factorwise action.** For linear maps $\phi:E\to E$ and $\psi:G\to G$, the map $\phi\otimes\psi$ is linear with $(\phi\otimes\psi)(\xi\otimes\eta)=\phi(\xi)\otimes\psi(\eta)$; its matrix is the Kronecker product of the two matrices. Bilinear forms combine the same way:
$$\langle \xi\otimes\eta,\ \xi'\otimes\eta'\rangle=\langle \xi,\xi'\rangle_E\,\langle \eta,\eta'\rangle_G .$$
A form is nondegenerate when its Gram matrix (the matrix of pairings of basis vectors) is invertible, which is why dimensions must be finite. The Gram matrix of the product form is the Kronecker product of the two Gram matrices, so a product of nondegenerate forms is nondegenerate.

**Subspaces.** Let $A$ and $C$ be finite-dimensional spaces with nondegenerate forms, $P\subseteq A$ a subspace, and $Q\subseteq C$ a subspace. Extending bases of $P$ and $Q$ to bases of $A$ and $C$ shows that $P\otimes Q$ is a subspace of $A\otimes C$ of dimension $\dim P\cdot\dim Q$.

Let $P$ be nondegenerate and $B=P^\perp$ its orthogonal complement in $A$, so $A=B\perp P$. Take a basis of $A$ made of a basis of $B$ followed by one of $P$. The basis vectors $\mathbf b\otimes\mathbf g_j$ of $A\otimes C$ span $B\otimes C$ and the vectors $\mathbf p\otimes\mathbf g_j$ span $P\otimes C$, so together they span $A\otimes C$ with no overlap. The two subspaces are orthogonal, because $\langle\mathbf b\otimes\mathbf g_j,\mathbf p\otimes\mathbf g_{j'}\rangle=\langle\mathbf b,\mathbf p\rangle\langle\mathbf g_j,\mathbf g_{j'}\rangle=0$ and pure tensors span. Hence
$$A\otimes C=(B\otimes C)\perp(P\otimes C),\qquad \dim(A\otimes C)=\dim B\cdot\dim C+\dim P\cdot\dim C.$$
This is how gate-label dimensions are computed in the nested-label construction.

**In the argument.** Take a space $F$ of dimension $h$ with a nondegenerate form. The label space is $F\otimes F\otimes F$, of dimension $h^3=m$, and it is nondegenerate (cited) An empty tensor product counts as the ground field, of dimension one (cited), so a stage with no factors contributes a factor $1$.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0203-audit-tensor-product-of-spaces.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0203-audit-tensor-product-of-spaces` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0203-audit-tensor-product-of-spaces`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
