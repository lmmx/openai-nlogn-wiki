# exegenius task 0011-write-scratch-restoring-exchange

Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F8V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Scratch-restoring bank exchange
Gloss: A fixed linear network of copy, gather, scatter and side-injection gates that swaps two banks of values in three stages while returning every auxiliary (scratch) wire to its arbitrary initial value.

## This page in the argument

The step: A fixed linear network of copy, gather, scatter and side-injection gates exchanges two banks, sending $(X_a,Y_a)$ to $(-Y_a,X_a)$ in three stages, and returns every scratch wire to its arbitrary initial value.
How: Give each invocation an eight-row schedule whose first and last rows cancel the unknown scratch values, so that the net map is $y\leftarrow y+x$; then chain three such invocations.
Why: Scratch wires may start with arbitrary values, so the schedule first subtracts their effect and finally restores them. (the sources say so: "the following schedule remove the effect of the old scratch values;" (paper))
Striking feature: The net effect of the network is independent of the arbitrary initial values of all auxiliary (scratch) wires, and each scratch wire ends with its own initial value. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- For arbitrary initial scratch values, one invocation changes $y_S$ to $y_S+x_S$ and leaves every other value unchanged.
- Three invocations (forward, inverse, forward) turn $(x,y)$ into $(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$, which is the bank exchange with a sign.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Build two faster tape procedures (address chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) from rank-saving linear networks, use them in synthetic polynomial transforms and resampled source transforms for a convolution, reduce integer multiplication to that convolution, then prove exactness and add up costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- There are two fixed linear networks on $W$ wires with labels of dimension $m$ whose edge changes cost $s<Wm$ smaller operations in total, one acting by bit address shears and one by phase kernels.; how: Design a scalar network that exchanges banks and restores scratch, lift it to arrays through frames, then choose subspace labels so each edge change is cheap and the total rank $s$ is below $Wm$.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (A.1.1, A.1.2). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**A.1.1**: For arbitrary initial scratch values, one invocation changes $y_S$ to $y_S+x_S$ and leaves every other value unchanged.
Source: "invocation changes $y_S$ to $y_S+x_S$ and leaves every other value" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}\label{lem:scalar-motifs} For arbitrary initial values of its auxiliary wires, a forward invocation changes $y_S$ to $y_S+x_S$ and leaves every other value unchanged. Performing a forward invocation from $X$ to $Y$ at stage 1, the inverse forward schedule from $Y$ to $X$ at stage 2, and a forward invocation from $X$ to $Y$ at stage 3 sends \[ (X_a,Y_a)\longmapsto(-Y_a,X_a) \] and restores every auxiliary value. In the bit construction this is the permutation exchanging $X_a$ and $Y_a$. \end{lemma}

**A.1.2**: Three invocations (forward, inverse, forward) turn $(x,y)$ into $(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$, which is the bank exchange with a sign.
Source: "$(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$." (paper)
> The inverse schedule with logical source $Y$ and target $X$ effects $X\gets X-Y$. Starting from $(x,y)$, the three stages give $(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$. Each invocation restores its own auxiliary wires. \end{proof}

## Pages that build on this one

- Frames: changing representation along a network: Replacing each scalar wire by an array and storing it as D_v g for an invertible operator D_v (a frame), so that a pointwise linear gate commutes with the frame and only the endpoint operator remains.
- Triple-subset labels and the rank budget: Subspaces of a fixed space attached to gates and terminals, built from indicator vectors of three-element subsets so that adjacent labels are nested and the total edge rank s is strictly less than the wire count W times the dimension m.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "We construct two fixed linear networks that exchange two banks of values while restoring every auxiliary value." (paper)

  > We construct two fixed linear networks that exchange two banks of values while restoring every auxiliary value. When the values are replaced by arrays, a common representation on all wires at a gate lets that gate act pointwise without disturbing the representation. We explain this invariant before constructing the subspace labels that make changes of representation cheap. The first network uses bit values and rational subspaces; the second uses Gaussian dyadic values and binary subspaces. The scalar domain specifies the values combined at a gate, while the subspace labels are used to construct operators on each wire's address-indexed array.

- "the last two restore the scratch values" (paper)

  > {T:\,|S\cap T|=1}A_{ST}$ to $y_S$. The gather adds $\sum_{T\ni i}x_T$ to $C_i$, and the scatter adds $\sum_{i\in S}C_i$ to $y_S$. \item In the complex construction, scalars lie in $\mathbb Z[i,1/2]$, and neighbors are distinct triples with even intersection. Copy is unchanged. Side injection adds \[ -\sum_{T\text{ neighboring }S}\frac{|S\cap T|-1}{2}A_{ST} \] to $y_S$. Gather adds $\sum_{T\ni i}x_T$ to $C_i$ and $\sum_Tx_T$ to $C_\ast$. Scatter adds $(\sum_{i\in S}C_i-C_\ast)/2$ to $y_S$. \end{itemize} Each update leaves its control wires unchanged. The first two rows of the following schedule remove the effect of the old scratch values; the next four introduce the source values and add their effect to the target; the last two restore the scratch values. This cancellation of arbitrary initial scratch values is a linear instance of the restoration construction for transparent computation in Buhrman, Cleve, Kouck\'y, Loff and Speelman~\cite[Section~3]{BuhrmanCleveKouckyLoffSpeelman2014}. The forward schedule is \begin{equation} \begin{array}{c|l|l} \text{row}&\text{operation}&\text{gate grouping}\\ \hline 0&\text{subtract side injection}&\text{one gate per target}\\ 1&\text{subtract scatter}&\text{one gate on targets and center}\\ 2&\text{copy}&\text{one gate per source}\\ 3&\text{gather}&\text{one gate on sources and center}\\ 4&\text{scatter}&\text{one gate on targets and center}\\ 5&\text{side injection}&\text{one gate per target}\\ 6&\text{undo gather}&\text{one gate

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0011-write-scratch-restoring-exchange.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0011-write-scratch-restoring-exchange.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0011-write-scratch-restoring-exchange` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0011-write-scratch-restoring-exchange`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
