# exegenius task 0095-write-packed-bit-addition

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle" (paper)

  > ess positions in O(V ) time. Each operation uses a fixed number of one-dimensional tapes and restores the order of all spectator fields. The asymptotic simplification in the following lemma describes a fixed family of parameters as p → ∞, after the exponents and comparison constants have been fixed. The statement that R exceeds every fixed polynomial in p means that R/pC → ∞ for each fixed C. Implied constants and eventual cutoffs may depend on the fixed choices and on when the family’s asserted bounds begin to hold. In particular, each explicit bound is uniform over all of its declared inputs; its asymptotic simplification is uniform over the allowed row counts and payloads within a fixed family. Lemma 13 (Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle). Let R ≥ 1, K ≥ 6, f ≥ 1, L = f K, and 0 ≤ ρ < K. Let N0 , N1 , N2 , N3 be positive integers, and let (χ1 , χ2 , χ3 ) be a permutation of (x, y, z). Consider R-bit records in lexicographic order on [N0 ] × [2L ]χ1 × [N1 ] × [2L ]χ2 × [N2 ] × [2L ]χ3 × [N3 ].

- The reader cannot follow this step: "these shifts have the required effect away from a small set of addresses" (The page asserts that the shifts are correct except on a small set of addresses and that the correction fixes exactly that set, with no argument or reference the reader can check from the page.). Either give the reasoning, or attribute the step to the source with a citation; choose whichever needs fewer words.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 350 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 437 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

Packed selected-bit addition is a fixed multitape procedure that performs many binary row additions in one pass. It supplies the binary basis changes for the [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md), whose exact computation needs them.

A binary row addition adds one row of a matrix into another in every column, so it changes the selected bits of two whole address chunks at once. The procedure performs the XORs of one such addition together, rather than one bit position at a time.

The record's address is split into three chunks, named $x$, $y$, and $z$; in this page these letters name chunks, so $y$ no longer means the polynomial variable. Each chunk is $L$ bits wide, with $L = fK$, where $f$ is the number of selected positions in each chunk and $K$ is the spacing between them.

The selected positions start at offset $\rho$, with $0 \le \rho < K$. The $i$-th selected position is $j_i = \rho + iK$ for $0 \le i < f$, counted from the least significant bit. The procedure computes

$$y_{j_i} \leftarrow y_{j_i} \oplus x_{j_i} \qquad (0 \le i < f),$$

so the selected bits of $x$ are XORed into the same positions of $y$, where $\oplus$ is exclusive or.

For example, take $f=2$, $K=6$, $L=12$ and $\rho=1$, so the selected positions are $j_0=1$ and $j_1=7$. If the $x$ bits there are $1$ and $0$, and the $y$ bits are $1$ and $1$, the procedure leaves the $y$ bits as $0$ and $1$.

The construction applies a constant number of cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges, and these shifts have the required effect away from a small set of addresses. The procedure then corrects exactly that set. The construction is built from three streaming operations: an [address-field interchange](address-interchange.md) of equal-width chunks, cyclic shifts of chunk ranges, and a fixed permutation of two-bit values. It is a restricted form of the [address shear](address-shear.md) that changes only the selected positions.

The correction term in the time is scaled by $\delta_{\text{bad}} = \min\{1, 80(f-1)2^{-K}\}$, which is small when $K$ is large.

Each record has $R$ bits, a bit count distinct from the coefficient count $r$. Let $N_0,\dots,N_3$ be the sizes of the four other coordinate ranges, so $M = 2^{3L}N_0N_1N_2N_3$ counts the records, and $V = MR$ is the total number of bits. Here $\tau$ is a fixed exponent with $0<\tau<1$. Under the asymptotic conditions of the lemma, the time is $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ <cite data-source="paper">When Arect = O(p), R exceeds every fixed polynomial in p, f ≤ d ≤ p, and K/ log p → ∞, this is O(V (Lτ + 1))</cite>.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

```json
{
  "$defs": {
    "Edge": {
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "description": "What this page uses one prerequisite page for.",
      "properties": {

          "description": "A short predicate built from the sentence's own words, such that \"<this page's\nconcept> <predicate> <prerequisite>\" is a true sentence: \"is reduced to\", \"computes\nits transforms by\", \"is based on\".",

        },

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0095-write-packed-bit-addition.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0095-write-packed-bit-addition.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0095-write-packed-bit-addition` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.
