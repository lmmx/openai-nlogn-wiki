# exegenius task 0415-audit-line-spanned-by-vector

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Line spanned by a vector

A line spanned by a vector is the set of all scalar multiples of one nonzero vector, a one-dimensional subspace. The construction labels the wires of the [subset-intersection network](subset-intersection-network.md) with such lines. That network is linear:.

Let $K$ be the field of scalars and $E$ a vector space over $K$. Its definition is built from the vector spaces and scalar multiples of [Linear algebra basics](linear-algebra-basics.md). For a nonzero vector $v \in E$ (here $v$ is a vector, not a vertex), the line spanned by $v$, written $\operatorname{span}\{v\}$, is the set $\{cv : c \in K\}$, where $c$ is a scalar, an element of $K$.

The line is a subspace: for a second scalar $c' \in K$, $cv + c'v = (c+c')v$ and $c'(cv) = (c'c)v$ keep it closed. It has dimension one, because $v$ spans it and $cv = 0$ with $c \neq 0$ would force $v = 0$.

Take $K = \mathbb{R}$, the field of real numbers, $E = \mathbb{R}^2$ and $v = (1,2)$. Then $\operatorname{span}\{v\} = \{(c, 2c) : c \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is the line through the origin with slope 2. The point $(3,6) = 3v$ lies on it, but $(1,3)$ does not: its first coordinate forces $c = 1$, and then the second coordinate is $2$, not $3$.

Suppose the space carries a [bilinear form](bilinear-form.md) $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$. A subspace $U$ is nondegenerate when no nonzero vector of $U$ is orthogonal to every vector of $U$. For a line, nondegeneracy is decided by the [bilinear form](bilinear-form.md) on the single vector $v$. For a second scalar $c' \in K$, bilinearity gives $\langle cv, c'v\rangle = cc'\langle v,v\rangle$. So $cv$ is orthogonal to the whole line exactly when $c\langle v,v\rangle = 0$, and a nonzero vector of the line has $c \neq 0$. The line is therefore nondegenerate exactly when $\langle v,v\rangle \neq 0$.

The paper gives no reason for nondegeneracy. Here is one: for a nondegenerate $U$, $U$ is disjoint from its [orthogonal complement](orthogonal-complement.md) $U^\perp$, since a vector in both would be a vector of $U$ orthogonal to all of $U$.

In the construction, each label is a line spanned by a [tensor product](tensor-product.md) of three indicator vectors of triples. For a choice $\tau = (\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3)$ of three triples, write $u_\tau = t_{\tau_1} \otimes t_{\tau_2} \otimes t_{\tau_3}$ and $U_\tau = \operatorname{span}\{u_\tau\}$; the paper's definition is. The two data banks $X_\tau$ and $Y_\tau$ carry it:, and.

For the bit network the paper uses the form with. The indicator vector $t_T$ of a triple has three entries equal to 1, so each entry of $Jt_T$ is $3$, giving $t_T^{\mathsf T}Jt_T = 9$, while $t_T^{\mathsf T}t_T = 3$. Hence $\langle t_T,t_T\rangle = 3 - 9/9 = 2$, matching the paper: So the line passes the test, as the paper concludes:.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0415-audit-line-spanned-by-vector.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0415-audit-line-spanned-by-vector` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.
