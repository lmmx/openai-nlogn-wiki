# exegenius task 0016-write-bank-exchange-network

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/O1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Bank-exchange linear network
Gloss: A fixed linear network of pointwise gates on wires (roles) that, in three stages, exchanges two banks of values with prescribed signs while restoring every auxiliary scratch wire.
Also called: finite network, role, bit network, complex network

## This page in the argument

The step: Three stages of invocations send $(X_a,Y_a)\mapsto(-Y_a,X_a)$ and restore every scratch wire, whatever its initial value.
How: compose a forward invocation $y\gets y+x$, an inverse invocation $x\gets x-y$, and a forward invocation, each with its own restored scratch wires
Why: Three additive updates realize an exchange up to sign, and each update can be built from gather, scatter and side wires whose old values are subtracted first. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: The exchange is exact for arbitrary initial scratch values, so scratch wires can later be fed arbitrary existing data. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Gather and scatter through the $h$ central wires give coefficient $|S\cap T|$ modulo two (or $(|S\cap T|-1)/2$), the side wires cancel the unwanted neighbor coefficients, and the net effect of one invocation is $y_S\gets y_S+x_S$. (on [Three-element-subset intersection construction](triple-intersection.md))
- The three stages take $(x,y)$ to $(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of radix digits, move it by a Chinese-remainder map and Gaussian resampling to power-of-two axes, compute that convolution with synthetic polynomial transforms accelerated by two network-based tape procedures, recover the exact coefficients by rounding, and bound every cost term (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures save a power of their parameter: chunk interchange in $O(Vu^\tau)$ and a simultaneous butterfly layer in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with $\tau,\lambda'<1$.; how: derive both from fixed linear networks with a rank deficit, transferred to arrays by frames on role streams and applied recursively
- There are two fixed linear networks with $W$ wires that exchange two banks while restoring all scratch wires, whose edge changes need in total $s<Wm$ smaller calls, so that $s/W<m^\tau$ with $\tau=1-2^{-50}$.; how: build a three-stage bank exchange from triple-subset invocations, attach nested nondegenerate subspace labels to its vertices, and count the dimensions of the edge residuals (on [Rank deficit and recursive power saving](rank-deficit.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.2.1.2). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.2.1.2**: The three stages take $(x,y)$ to $(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$.
Source: "$(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$." (paper)
> The inverse schedule with logical source $Y$ and target $X$ effects $X\gets X-Y$. Starting from $(x,y)$, the three stages give $(x,y+x)$, then $(-y,y+x)$, then $(-y,x)$. Each invocation restores its own auxiliary wires. \end{proof}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S1.2.1.1 (on [Three-element-subset intersection construction](triple-intersection.md)): Gather and scatter through the $h$ central wires give coefficient $|S\cap T|$ modulo two (or $(|S\cap T|-1)/2$), the side wires cancel the unwanted neighbor coefficients, and the net effect of one invocation is $y_S\gets y_S+x_S$.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Linear maps, matrices and rank](linear-algebra.md): Vector spaces over a field (including the two-element field F₂ where addition is XOR), linear maps, matrices, subspaces, dimension and rank.
  Shown as: Bank-exchange linear network *<predicate>* Linear maps, matrices and rank
- [Scratch restoration](scratch-restoration.md): The transparent-computation trick of subtracting a scratch register's effect, computing, adding, and uncomputing, so that the net result is independent of arbitrary initial scratch values.
  Shown as: Bank-exchange linear network *<predicate>* Scratch restoration
- [Three-element-subset intersection construction](triple-intersection.md): The Frankl–Wilson-style use of 3-subsets of a 100-element set, where gather and scatter produce coefficients depending on intersection size and side wires cancel the unwanted ones, giving y ← y + x.
  Shown as: Bank-exchange linear network *<predicate>* Three-element-subset intersection construction

## Pages that build on this one

- Row splitting into role streams: Rows of an array are distributed cyclically among the network's W roles so each role stream has volume V/W, and recursive calls are scheduled depth-first on a fixed set of tapes by parking inactive streams on a stack.
- Frames and the common-frame identity: Each network vertex gets an invertible linear operator (frame) giving the stored array's representation; since a common frame commutes with pointwise gates, the network implements the endpoint frame ratio on every role.
- Simultaneous butterfly layer: Applying the butterfly H₀ on one selected bit in each of up to d address chunks at once in O(V d^λ′) time, λ′ < 1, by running the complex network with phase frames recursively and truncating once at the end.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "We construct two fixed linear networks that exchange two banks of values while restoring every auxiliary value." (paper)

  > We construct two fixed linear networks that exchange two banks of values while restoring every auxiliary value. When the values are replaced by arrays, a common representation on all wires at a gate lets that gate act pointwise without disturbing the representation. We explain this invariant before constructing the subspace labels that make changes of representation cheap. The first network uses bit values and rational subspaces; the second uses Gaussian dyadic values and binary subspaces. The scalar domain specifies the values combined at a gate, while the subspace labels are used to construct operators on each wire's address-indexed array.

- "A wire's fixed place in the network is called its role." (paper)

  > Each procedure arises from its own fixed linear network that exchanges two banks of values, with prescribed signs, and restores every auxiliary value. A wire's fixed place in the network is called its role. To use the network on an array, regard a row as the complete ordered suffix, including all active address fields, at a fixed prefix and row index. Distribute rows cyclically among the $W$ roles, padding the row count for each prefix to a multiple of $W$. Let $V$ now denote the node volume after padding. All role streams have the same local address set and each contains $V/W$ bits. A scalar gate is then applied pointwise to matching addresses on the roles that it touches.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-bank-exchange-network.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-bank-exchange-network.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0016-write-bank-exchange-network` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-bank-exchange-network`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
