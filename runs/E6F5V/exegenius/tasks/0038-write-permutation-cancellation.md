Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F5V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Cancellation of the retained source permutation
Gloss: The coordinate permutation R left inside the resampled transform cancels across two forward transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite transform, giving R F⁺[(R F u)·(R F v)] = u*v/S².

## This page in the argument

The step: The coordinate permutation $R$ left inside the resampled transform cancels across two forward transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite transform: $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+[(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\cdot(RF_{\boldsymbol s}v)]=u*v/S^2$.
How: Show that $R$ is a dilation by a unit modulo each $s_i$, so that $F^+R=R^{-1}F^+$ and $RF^+R=F^+$, then apply the convolution theorem.
Why: Because pointwise products commute with coordinate permutations, the permutation sitting between the transforms can be moved through them and absorbed by its inverse. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: The permutation $R$ appears twice and yet leaves no trace in the final convolution $u*v/S^2$: the two occurrences cancel because $R$ is a dilation by a unit modulo each $s_i$, which satisfies $RF^+R=F^+$. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Each $t_i$ is a unit modulo $s_i$, so tensoring $F_q^+R_c=R_c^{-1}F_q^+$ gives $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$.
- The pointwise product is passed through $R$, and the normalized convolution rule applies to the remaining transforms.
- The two normalizations give $F^+_{\boldsymbol s}(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\cdot F_{\boldsymbol s}v)=u*v/S^2$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, using fast address interchange and fast simultaneous butterfly layers inside a Gaussian-resampling, chirp and synthetic-transform reduction.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution evaluated through Gaussian-resampled, chirped synthetic transforms, make the two costly tape operations (address movement and butterfly layers) cheaper by a power of the logarithm using networks with a rank saving, and then assemble the algorithm and add up its costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- The Fourier transform of coprime source lengths $s_i$ is expressed, with its two coordinate permutations left inside the identity, through transforms on the padded power-of-two box of lengths $t_i$, using linewise Gaussian maps, a Bluestein chirp convolution, and a cancellation of the retained source permutation across a convolution.; how: Apply Gaussian resampling line by line along each axis of the padded box, rewrite the middle power-of-two transform as a convolution with a chirp, and show that the leftover permutation cancels in a product.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S8.4.1, S8.4.2, S8.4.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S8.4.1**: Each $t_i$ is a unit modulo $s_i$, so tensoring $F_q^+R_c=R_c^{-1}F_q^+$ gives $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$.
Source: "Each $t_i$ is a unit modulo $s_i$, so tensoring this identity gives" (paper)
> For a unit $c$ modulo $q$, let $(R_cz)_j=z_{cj}$. Substituting $h=ck$ in the Fourier sum gives \[ (F_q^+R_cz)_j =\frac1q\sum_{h=0}^{q-1}z_h e^{2\pi i h c^{-1}j/q} =(R_c^{-1}F_q^+z)_j. \] Each $t_i$ is a unit modulo $s_i$, so tensoring this identity gives $F_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=R^{-1}F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$ and hence $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$. Also $(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot}(RF_{\boldsymbol s}v) =R(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot}F_{\boldsymbol s}v)$, because a coordinate permutation commutes with pointwise products. Therefore \[ RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+\bigl[R(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot} F_{\boldsymbol s}v)\bigr] =F_{\boldsymbol s}^+(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot} F_{\boldsymbol s}v). \] The normalized convolution rule is $F_{\boldsymbol s}(u*v)=S(F_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot} (F_{\boldsymbol s}v)$, while $F_{\boldsymbol s}^+F_{\boldsymbol s}

**S8.4.2**: The pointwise product is passed through $R$, and the normalized convolution rule applies to the remaining transforms.
Source: "The normalized convolution rule is" (paper)
> ourier sum gives \[ (F_q^+R_cz)_j =\frac1q\sum_{h=0}^{q-1}z_h e^{2\pi i h c^{-1}j/q} =(R_c^{-1}F_q^+z)_j. \] Each $t_i$ is a unit modulo $s_i$, so tensoring this identity gives $F_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=R^{-1}F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$ and hence $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$. Also $(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot}(RF_{\boldsymbol s}v) =R(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot}F_{\boldsymbol s}v)$, because a coordinate permutation commutes with pointwise products. Therefore \[ RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+\bigl[R(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot} F_{\boldsymbol s}v)\bigr] =F_{\boldsymbol s}^+(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot} F_{\boldsymbol s}v). \] The normalized convolution rule is $F_{\boldsymbol s}(u*v)=S(F_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot} (F_{\boldsymbol s}v)$, while $F_{\boldsymbol s}^+F_{\boldsymbol s}=I/S$. The two normalizations give \[ F_{\boldsymbol s}^+ (F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot}F_{\boldsymbol s}v) =\frac1S F_{\boldsymbol s}^+F_{\boldsymbol s}(u*v) =\frac{u*v}{S^2}, \] proving \eqref{eq:source-permutation-cancel}. Finally, conjugation changes the negative Fourier sign to the positive one and commutes with the real permutation $R$. It preserves both the disk grid and the norm, so conjugating the input and output also preserves an algorithm's error bound. \end{proof} \section{Exact integer multiplication and its cost} \label{sec:assembly}

**S8.4.3**: The two normalizations give $F^+_{\boldsymbol s}(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\cdot F_{\boldsymbol s}v)=u*v/S^2$.

The two normalizations give \[ F_{\boldsymbol s}^+ (F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot}F_{\boldsymbol s}v) =\frac1S F_{\boldsymbol s}^+F_{\boldsymbol s}(u*v) =\frac{u*v}{S^2}, \] proving \eqref{eq:source-permutation-cancel}.

## Pages that build on this one

- The multiplication algorithm: Split the operands into radix digits, map them by Φ to prime axes, apply the source transform to each, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, rescale by S and 2^{2b+4}, round to integers, undo Φ and propagate carries.
- Precision and exact recovery: Disk-margin and error bookkeeping shows the recovered coefficient error stays below 1/2, so rounding gives the exact integer convolution coefficients and carries give the exact binary product.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Finally, the source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product, and the opposite-sign transform." (paper)

  > Finally, the source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product, and the opposite-sign transform. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} removes the known normalizations and digit scales, proves that the recovered coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$, and propagates carries to obtain the exact binary product. A compatible choice of rational parameters makes all terms in its cost table fit Theorem~\ref{thm:main}. Figure~\ref{fig:multiplication-flow} summarizes these reductions.

- "The second identity shows how the retained source permutation $R$ cancels when computing a convolution." (paper)

  > The factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ in \eqref{eq:no-sort-tensor} can be computed from a cyclic convolution and two pointwise phase multiplications. The chirp identity below performs the frequency change in $Q$ without applying $Q$ as a separate permutation of the array. The second identity shows how the retained source permutation $R$ cancels when computing a convolution. Here $*$ denotes cyclic convolution on the product of the coordinate groups and a dot denotes coordinatewise multiplication.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0038-write-permutation-cancellation.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0038-write-permutation-cancellation.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0038-write-permutation-cancellation` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0038-write-permutation-cancellation`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
