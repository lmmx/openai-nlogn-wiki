# exegenius task 0459-audit-established-multiplier

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Established O(n log n) multiplier

The established multiplier is a known fixed-tape integer multiplier, and it solves [exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md). The [main theorem](main-theorem.md) uses it only through its cost bound, which is one term of the new algorithm's [cost table](cost-table.md).

We write $\log$ for the base-2 logarithm. Here $N$ is the number of bits in each input. The source calls the multiplier der Hoeven, and its cost is. Since $\log(2N)=\log N+1$ and $\log N\ge 1$ for $N\ge 2$, we get $\log(2N)\le 2\log N$, so the cost is $O(N\log N)$ for $N\ge 2$.

For example, take $N=4$, $x=1011$ (value $11$) and $y=0110$ (value $6$). The product is $66$, so the multiplier outputs the $2N$-bit string $01000010$.

The construction packs the coefficients of each polynomial into one large integer, multiplies two such integers with this multiplier, and unpacks the result (see [signed coefficient packing](signed-packing.md)). The source states this step as

The multiplier is Harvey and van der Hoeven's algorithm, not the new theorem. The source says of these calls: So the construction never calls itself. Each call is charged the $O(N\log N)$ cost on its own inputs, taken as given, and these charges are summed in the cost table.
