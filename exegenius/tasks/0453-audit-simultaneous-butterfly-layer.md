# exegenius task 0453-audit-simultaneous-butterfly-layer

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Simultaneous butterfly layer

A simultaneous butterfly layer applies the two-point map of a [butterfly](butterfly.md) to one selected bit of each of $D$ [transform axes](transform-axis.md) at once, and computes the exact result in one tape procedure instead of one axis at a time. It is the step that lets a transform round apply its butterflies on all participating axes together. A transform round is one step of a multidimensional transform:

The layer acts on $D$ [transform axes](transform-axis.md), each a chunk of $\delta$ consecutive address bits, where $\delta$ is the number of bits in each chunk. In each chunk one bit is selected, at offset $o$ with $0\le o<\delta$, where $o$ is the position of the selected bit within its chunk, counted from the least significant end. The layer acts on these $D$ selected bits and fixes every other bit. Each address holds a record, a polynomial with $r$ complex coefficients, and the layer acts on every coefficient of it.

With $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$, the layer is the [tensor power](tensor-product.md) of $H_0$ on the selected bits, written $H_0^{\otimes D}$. The layer applies the length-two case of the [discrete Fourier transform](discrete-fourier-transform.md) to each selected bit. With the normalization $(F_q u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{-2\pi i jk/q}$, that case is exactly $H_0$, because $e^{-\pi i jk}=(-1)^{jk}$. The unitary normalization $1/\sqrt q$ would instead give the normalized Hadamard matrix $\mathcal{H}=\frac1{\sqrt2}\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}=\sqrt2\,H_0$.

Take $D=2$, $\delta=1$ and $o=0$, so each address has two bits, the first belonging to the first axis. Put the values $1,2,3,4$ at addresses $00,01,10,11$. Applying $H_0$ to the first bit combines the pairs $(00,10)$ and $(01,11)$: the values $(1,3)$ become $2,-1$, and $(2,4)$ become $3,-1$. Applying $H_0$ to the second bit combines $(00,01)$, now holding $2,3$, into $2.5,-0.5$, and $(10,11)$, holding $-1,-1$, into $-1,0$. The result is $2.5,-0.5,-1,0$; for instance $2.5=(1+2+3+4)/4$.

Applying the one-axis factors in turn is costly:, where one pass reads and rewrites every stored record. The sources instead run the whole layer as, a fixed sequence of reads and writes on the tapes. Three rewritings make this possible.

First, phase identities. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the normalized Hadamard matrix of the previous paragraph, $\Delta=\mathrm{diag}(1,i)$ a diagonal phase matrix, and $X=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}$ the bit-flip matrix. Let $\lambda=(1+i)/2$ and $\mu=(1-i)/2$, where $\lambda$ is the coefficient of the identity $I$ and $\mu$ the coefficient of $X$. Define $C=\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}$, which equals $\lambda I+\mu X$. The layer is built from the [two-point kernel](two-point-kernel.md) $C$ on each selected bit. Direct multiplication gives $H_0=\mu\,\Delta C\,\Delta$, hence $H_0^{\otimes D}=\mu^D\,\Delta_D\,C^{\otimes D}\,\Delta_D$, where $\Delta_D$ multiplies the value at each address by $i$ raised to the number of selected bits equal to 1 there. The layer expresses its phase frames through the [complex phase network](complex-phase-network.md), as products of $C$ on the selected bits. Since the phase factors are diagonal, the remaining work is $C^{\otimes D}$.

Second, binary changes of basis. $C^{\otimes D}$ still acts on all $D$ bits. The layer splits selected bits into groups by [binary changes of basis](binary-change-of-basis.md), which are invertible row additions over the binary field that relabel the bits. The layer moves its address chunks by [address-field interchange](address-interchange.md), a tape procedure:. The sources realise each change this way:

Third, exact values and one truncation. After $s$ factors of $H_0$, a coefficient has denominator $2^{s}$ times the working grid: The width therefore stays $O(p)$ bits per component. The layer rests on [Gaussian dyadics](gaussian-dyadics.md): The procedure ends with one final [truncation](truncation.md) of its values. Rounding once, at the end, gives the output of $H_0^{\otimes D}$ to the working precision.
