# exegenius task 0027-outline

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Organise the finished pages of an explanatory wiki into parts, and write its front page. The wiki explains a target result to a specific reader, one concept per page.

- Group the pages into parts that the reader works through in order, each a coherent stage of the explanation (for example: background, the main construction, the analysis). Aim for 3 to 8 parts; a small wiki may need fewer.
- Put every page in exactly one part, or in the glossary. Each page's prerequisites (listed below) must be in the glossary, the same part or an earlier one; submit rejects an outline that breaks this. Pages within a part are shown in reading order automatically, so their order in your list does not matter.
- Glossary: minor pages that define a term in a few sentences rather than explain an idea, such as a short page on a piece of terminology that one or two other pages use. They move to a glossary page, out of the reading order; links to them still work. Keep every page that explains a method, construction, result or argument in a part. Never put the target in the glossary. The word count and the number of pages using each page are listed to help.
- If the argument's main steps are listed below, base the parts on them where the prerequisites allow: a part per main step, with the pages that present its sub-steps, and background parts for the concepts the steps rely on.
- Part titles: 2 to 5 words, plain text, no numbering.
- Part intros: 2 to 4 sentences on what the part covers and why the reader needs it for what comes next. Link pages as `[Name](id.md)`.
- Overview: the front page, 150 to 350 words, for the reader described below. Say what the target result is and why it matters, then the route the wiki takes to it, part by part, naming the key ideas and linking their pages as `[Name](id.md)`. No headings.
- Write for this reader: concrete and specific, with no filler and no rhetorical flourishes. Mathematics in LaTeX ($...$). Links to anything other than the pages listed are rejected; external URLs are allowed.

## Target

Prime source lengths: Distinct odd primes chosen close to the powers of two that are the padded axis lengths, so that their product fills a fixed fraction of the padded box.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: This reader has an undergraduate computer science degree: discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, gcd and primes, binomial counting, induction), linear algebra over the reals and small fields (subspaces, rank, elimination, eigenvalues, dot-product orthogonal complements and projections), and algorithms (divide-and-conquer recurrences, Karatsuba multiplication, and the DFT and cyclic convolution as used for FFT-based polynomial multiplication). Complex numbers are known as far as roots of unity and Gaussian integers, Turing machines are known with multiple tapes, and basic probability reaches the union bound. Tensor products, bilinear forms beyond the dot product, quotient rings and the sources' network and address constructions are not part of this background.

## Pages, in reading order

- `exact-integer-multiplication`: [Exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md) — Given binary strings x and y of length n, output the 2n-bit binary representation of their product. (335 words, used by 1)
- `radix-digit-convolution`: [Radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md) — Writing both integers as polynomials in a power of two whose coefficients are their digits, so that their product is a polynomial convolution of short coefficients. Needs: exact-integer-multiplication. (295 words, used by 2)
- `gaussian-resampling`: [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md) — A technique that replaces a Fourier transform of arbitrary length by transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two, using Gaussian weights to move between the two sets of frequencies. Needs: radix-digit-convolution. (250 words, used by 1)
- `chinese-remainder-map`: [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md) — A relabeling of coefficient positions by mixed-radix digits for pairwise coprime lengths, which turns one cyclic convolution into a multidimensional cyclic convolution. Needs: radix-digit-convolution. (280 words, used by 1)
- `prime-source-lengths`: [Prime source lengths](prime-source-lengths.md) — Distinct odd primes chosen close to the powers of two that are the padded axis lengths, so that their product fills a fixed fraction of the padded box. Needs: chinese-remainder-map, gaussian-resampling. (442 words, used by 0)

## The argument's main steps

- For $x\in\{r/2,r\}$ the interval $((1-2\eta)x,(1-\eta)x]$ contains more than $d$ primes.
- Distinct odd primes $s_i$ with $(1-2\eta)t_i<s_i\le(1-\eta)t_i$ can be chosen, one for each axis $i$, because the two intervals are disjoint and lie above $2$.
- Each $\gcd(s_i,t_i)$ equals one, since $t_i$ is a power of two.
- The product $S=\prod_i s_i$ satisfies $T/2<S<T$.
