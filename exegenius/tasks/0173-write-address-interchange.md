# exegenius task 0173-write-address-interchange

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Fast address-chunk interchange
Gloss: The first tape procedure: exchanging two disjoint equal-width address fields of u digits in time O(V·u^τ) for a fixed τ < 1, using XOR combinations of intermediate data.
Also called: chunk swap, tape interchange, costly recursive primitive

## This page in the argument

The step: Bit variant: two disjoint address chunks of $u$ bits can be interchanged on a fixed number of tapes in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time, $\tau=1-2^{-50}$, although the intermediate steps form XOR combinations of data.
How: Run the bit network on the digits of the chunks: an edge whose matrix has rank $a$ costs $a$ interchanges of fields of $1/m$ the width (matrix shear), the $W$ role streams carry $1/W$ of the volume each, so the cost per unit volume satisfies $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$; then remove the restrictions on width and rows.
Why: The sum of the edge ranks is less than the number of wires times $m$, so the recurrence saves a power of the chunk width. (the sources say so: "An edge matrix of rank $a$ will require $a$ smaller interchanges." (paper))
Striking feature: The saving is a power $u^\tau$ with $\tau=1-2^{-50}$ only barely below 1, although the interchange has no data-dependent arithmetic. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- For a rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ and fields over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$, the shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work. (on [Matrix shear by triangular factorization](matrix-shear.md))
- Power-width interchange: if the circuit data satisfy the shear contract with $s<Wm$ and $s/W<m^\tau$, two disjoint chunks of $e=m^k$ radix-$q$ digits each (with a row field of length divisible by $W^k$ before both) can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time.
- For arbitrary widths $u$, prefixes, gaps and suffixes (including one-bit payloads) the interchange $(p,h,g,d,z)\mapsto(p,d,g,h,z)$ of two $u$-bit chunks costs $O(Vu^\tau)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic Turing machine with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture of Sch\"onhage and Strassen in this model.; how: Build two power-saving tape procedures (chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layer) from fixed finite linear networks; use them to accelerate the synthetic polynomial transforms and ring convolution; use Gaussian resampling with retained permutations and chirps to reduce the prime-length cyclic convolution of the radix-digit coefficients to those power-of-two transforms; assemble the exact product with a proof that the error is below $1/2$; and total the cost to show a power of $\log n$ is saved. (on [Power-saving integer multiplication](main-result.md))
- Both tape primitives (the interchange of two address chunks of $u$ digits and the simultaneous butterfly layer on up to $d$ axes) cost the volume times a power below one of their width, because a call at parameter $mf$ makes $s$ calls at parameter $f$ on streams of volume $V/W$ with $s<Wm$, so the cost per unit volume grows by $s/W<m$ per factor $m$ of the parameter.; how: Build a fixed finite linear network of $W$ wires that exchanges two banks and restores all scratch values, make the representation of each wire's array vary along the network through frames so that an edge costs one smaller call per unit of rank, show the total rank $s$ is below $Wm$, fix an exponent, and solve the recurrence in the bit variant (interchange) and the complex variant (butterfly layer). (on [Recursive power saving](rank-recurrence.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.5.2, S1.5.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.5.2**: Power-width interchange: if the circuit data satisfy the shear contract with $s<Wm$ and $s/W<m^\tau$, two disjoint chunks of $e=m^k$ radix-$q$ digits each (with a row field of length divisible by $W^k$ before both) can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time.
How: Reduce the interchange to the shear $H\gets H+D$, implement the shear by the bit network run on $W$ role streams of volume $V/W$ with frame $\Phi_{A_e}$ on each edge, each edge being $\operatorname{rank}(A_e)$ smaller interchanges, obtain the recurrence $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$ and solve it.
- S1.5.2.1: Write each chunk as $m$ consecutive $b=e/m$ digit fields, giving vectors $H,D$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$, and first construct the shear $H\gets H+D$.
  Source: "consecutive $b=e/m$ digit fields, giving vectors $H,D$ over" (paper)
  > \begin{proof} For $k=0$ apply the single-digit operation of Lemma~\ref{lem:elementary-streams}. For $k>0$, write each chunk as $m$ consecutive $b=e/m$ digit fields, giving vectors $H,D$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$. We first construct the shear $H\leftarrow H+D$.
- S1.5.2.2: Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix; row $r=Wg+(w-1)$ goes to stream $w$ as row $g$.
  Source: "Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix" (paper)
  > Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix preceding the row field. Write the original row number as $r=Wg+(w-1)$ with $1\le w\le W$; stream $w$ has row number $g$. These streams have exactly the same remaining shape, including the full ranges of $H$ and $D$. Each has logical volume $V/W$, and its row count is divisible by $W^{k-1}$.
- S1.5.2.3: Each role stream has logical volume $V/W$ and its row count is divisible by $W^{k-1}$, so the same argument applies one level down.
  Source: "logical volume $V/W$, and its row count is divisible by $W^{k-1}$." (paper)
  > Split whole rows cyclically into $W$ role streams within each prefix preceding the row field. Write the original row number as $r=Wg+(w-1)$ with $1\le w\le W$; stream $w$ has row number $g$. These streams have exactly the same remaining shape, including the full ranges of $H$ and $D$. Each has logical volume $V/W$, and its row count is divisible by $W^{k-1}$.
- S1.5.2.4: On every circuit edge apply $\Phi_{A_e}$ to that role stream, implemented by the matrix-shear lemma, recursively interchanging each pivot pair of $b$-digit fields.
  Source: "Lemma~\ref{lem:matrix-shear}, recursively interchanging each pivot pair" (paper)
  > For a rational matrix $M$, let $\Phi_M$ act on an array by moving its entry at address $(H,D)$ to $(H+MD,D)$, with every spectator unchanged. Thus $\Phi_M$ is the array permutation induced by that address map. Its inverse is $\Phi_{-M}$ and $\Phi_{M'}\Phi_M=\Phi_{M'+M}$. On every circuit edge apply $\Phi_{A_e}$ to that role stream; implement it by Lemma~\ref{lem:matrix-shear}, recursively interchanging each pivot pair of $b$-digit fields. Execute each circuit gate pointwise at matching addresses of its role streams.
- S1.5.2.5a: The frame at a vertex with matrix $M$ is the address permutation $\Phi_M$ and every edge changes it by $\Phi_{M'-M}$; a common address permutation commutes with every pointwise bit gate.

  > The row split supplies the common address set used in the frame identity~\eqref{eq:common-frame-identity}. Here the frame at a vertex with matrix $M$ is the address permutation $\Phi_M$, and every edge changes it by $\Phi_{M'-M}$. The same invariant proof applies because a common address permutation commutes with every pointwise bit gate. For the physical input arrays $f_w$, the logical arrays are $g_w=\Phi_{-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}}f_w$; this only specifies their interpretation, with no initial tape operation. The logical circuit routes $g_w$ to role $\rho(w)$. Thus its physical output satisfies \[ f'_{\rho(w)} =\Phi_{M_{\mathrm{out}(\rho(w))}} \Phi_{-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}}f_w =\Phi_{I_m}f_w, \] by~\eqref{eq:finite-shear-contract}. Merge by returning row $g$ of output role $\rho(w)$ to the original row $Wg+(w-1)$ within the same preceding prefix. This undoes $\rho$ and restores row order. The result is $H\leftarrow H+D$ on every original row, including rows assigned to scratch roles, whose initial values were arbitrary.
- S1.5.2.5b: By the endpoint contract the physical output is $f'_{\rho(w)}=\Phi_{M_{\mathrm{out}(\rho(w))}}\Phi_{-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}}f_w=\Phi_{I_m}f_w$.

- S1.5.2.5d: The interchange of the two full chunks is $D\gets D-H$, then $H\gets H+D$ (the circuit), then $D\gets H-D$, componentwise; only the middle shear uses the circuit.
  Source: "D\leftarrow D-H,\qquad H\leftarrow H+D,\qquad D\leftarrow H-D," (paper)
  > To interchange the two full chunks, perform \[ D\leftarrow D-H,\qquad H\leftarrow H+D,\qquad D\leftarrow H-D, \] componentwise. Only the middle shear uses the circuit. The other two updates target the later group and have linear cost. The transformation sends $(H,D)$ to $(D,H)$.
- S1.5.2.5e: The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$, each on one role stream of volume $V/W$.

  > The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$. Each acts on one role stream of volume $V/W$, retaining all other fields as spectators. Splitting, merging, gates, and triangular operations have total cost $O(V)$ because their number is fixed. Below we verify that scheduling the recursive calls on fixed tapes also costs $O(V)$ at this node. Thus if $F_k$ is a uniform upper bound for time divided by logical volume, then \begin{equation} \label{eq:swap-recurrence} F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1). \end{equation} For $a=s/W<m^\tau$ the geometric sum $\sum_{j=0}^k a^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$. If $a\le1$, the sum is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; if $a>1$, it is $O(a^k)$. Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.
- S1.5.2.5g: Therefore $F_0=O(1)$ (single-digit operation) and $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$, where the factor $s/W$ is the number of calls $s$ times the volume fraction $1/W$ of each.

  How: Unroll the recurrence to a geometric sum $\sum_{j=0}^{k}a^j$ with $a=s/W$ and bound it separately for $a\le1$ and $a>1$.

- S1.5.2.5f: Splitting, merging, gates, triangular operations and the parking-stack scheduling of the $s$ calls cost $O(V)$ at the node (a fixed number of operations on the node's own volume), not on the volume of the children.
  Source: "symbols at a parent node.  There are only the fixed number $s$ of child" (paper)
  > Each push, pop, copy, positioning operation, or erasure moves $O(V)$ symbols at a parent node. There are only the fixed number $s$ of child calls. This gives precisely the additional $O(V)$ term claimed above, even though each child itself has volume $V/W$. Temporary storage is therefore not substituted for logical volume in the factor $s/W$.

**S1.5.3**: For arbitrary widths $u$, prefixes, gaps and suffixes (including one-bit payloads) the interchange $(p,h,g,d,z)\mapsto(p,d,g,h,z)$ of two $u$-bit chunks costs $O(Vu^\tau)$.
How: Supply the required rows from the chunks' own $\rho=O(\log e)$ high digits, pad the rows to a multiple of $W^k$, split the remaining width $e-\rho$ in base $m$ into $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$, interchange each piece by the power-width case, and sum the geometric series.

  > \begin{lemma}[Arbitrary-width interchange] \label{lem:chunk-swap} There exist fixed $0<\tau<1$ and one fixed finite-alphabet multitape procedure with the following property. For positive integers $P,G,B$ and $u\ge1$, it transforms an arbitrary bit array on \[ [P]\times[2^u]\times[G]\times[2^u]\times[B] \] by the address permutation \[ (p,h,g,d,z)\longmapsto(p,d,g,h,z) \] in $O(Vu^\tau)$ steps, where $V=PG B\,2^{2u}$. The integers specifying the shape are part of the input. The time includes their processing, all padding and unpadding, and fixed-tape workspace cleanup. In particular, $B=1$ is allowed. \end{lemma}

Handle the bounded remaining set of widths by $e$ individual digit interchanges; the constant in $O(Ve^\tau)$ absorbs their cost.
- S1.5.3.3: Put $\rho=\lceil k\log W/(2\log q)\rceil$ so that $q^{2\rho}\ge W^k$; for large $e$, $1\le\rho<e$ and $\rho=O(\log(2e))$.

  Source: "Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with" (paper)
  > Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with $q^e\ge2^u$. Pad each of the two chunk ranges numerically from $[2^u]$ to $[q^e]$, putting zero in an entry if either chunk coordinate is invalid. The increase in volume is less than $q^2$, a fixed factor. The padding is a nested scan through consecutive valid and invalid intervals, with their lengths prepared from the shape. It costs $O(V)$ with a constant depending on $q$. Lexicographic radix-$q$ order of $[q^e]$ is its numerical order, just as binary order of $[2^u]$ is its numerical order. Padding therefore preserves the order of the existing entries without converting the digits of every address. The completed interchange preserves the set on which both chunk coordinates lie below $2^u$. Scan away the other entries to recover the desired binary array. Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is $O(Vu^\tau)$. \end{proof}

- $j$ (recursion depth), bound on [Recursive power saving](rank-recurrence.md): The number of recursion levels between the top call and the nodes considered.
- $\tau$ (saving exponent), bound on [Recursive power saving](rank-recurrence.md): A fixed exponent below 1 with s/W < m^tau, which makes an interchange cost O(V f^tau); here tau = 1 - 2^{-50}.
- $\eta$ (relative rank deficit), bound on [Recursive power saving](rank-recurrence.md): The fraction (Wm - s)/(Wm) by which the number of smaller calls s falls short of Wm.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Recursive power saving](rank-recurrence.md): Each call at parameter m·f makes s calls at parameter f on streams of 1/W the volume, so cost per unit volume grows by s/W < m per factor m, giving a power saving.

- [Matrix shear by triangular factorization](matrix-shear.md): Factoring a rational matrix as A = E₁ΠE₂ with lower triangular E₁, E₂ and partial permutation Π lets the shear (H,D)→(H+AD,D) be done with exactly rank(A) field interchanges.

## Pages that build on this one

- Packed selected-bit addition: XORing selected bits between two address chunks (with a third chunk as restored scratch) using cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges plus a repair of explicitly bounded exceptional addresses.
- Tape layout for synthetic transforms: Placing the selected bits of the participating axes at a common offset in K-bit chunks so each round of the synthetic transform is one simultaneous layer, costing less than log t passes.
- Cost accounting and the exponent κ: Dividing each cost by V = Tp, the dominant terms are powers of p below one with minimum margin 2^{-181} = 2κ, giving total time O(n(lg n)^{1−κ}).

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The first procedure interchanges two disjoint contiguous address" (paper)

  > The first procedure interchanges two disjoint contiguous address fields of $u$ bits in an array whose addresses form a complete Cartesian product. Its cost is $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$. Although its final effect is an exact permutation, its intermediate steps form pointwise XOR combinations of data. The final permutation is exact for arbitrary initial auxiliary values.

- "Arbitrary-width interchange" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Arbitrary-width interchange] \label{lem:chunk-swap} There exist fixed $0<\tau<1$ and one fixed finite-alphabet multitape procedure with the following property. For positive integers $P,G,B$ and $u\ge1$, it transforms an arbitrary bit array on \[ [P]\times[2^u]\times[G]\times[2^u]\times[B] \] by the address permutation \[ (p,h,g,d,z)\longmapsto(p,d,g,h,z) \] in $O(Vu^\tau)$ steps, where $V=PG B\,2^{2u}$. The integers specifying the shape are part of the input. The time includes their processing, all padding and unpadding, and fixed-tape workspace cleanup. In particular, $B=1$ is allowed. \end{lemma}


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- Say what $a_j$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "Split each remaining chunk into $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$"

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 431 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 538 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

Fast address-chunk interchange, a tape primitive for the main result, swaps two disjoint $u$-bit address fields of an array of $V$ bits (volume) in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time on fixed tapes <cite data-source="paper">Its cost is $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$.</cite>, with $\tau=1-2^{-50}$. Its steps XOR data.

An address is $(p,h,g,d,z)$: prefix $p$, chunks $h,d$, gap $g$, suffix $z$; the goal is $(p,h,g,d,z)\mapsto(p,d,g,h,z)$. Letters $u,p,h,d$ change meaning here. Digits are radix $q$ (a fixed prime).

For chunk values $H,D$, $D\gets D-H$, $H\gets H+D$, $D\gets H-D$ send $(H,D)$ to $(H,D-H)$, $(D,D-H)$, $(D,H)$. Only the middle shear needs the circuit.

Let each chunk have $e=m^k$ digits ($k$ recursion levels). Cut it into $m$ fields of $b=e/m$ digits, so $H,D$ are vectors over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$. The [exchange network](exchange-network.md) has $W$ wires; each terminal and gate carries a rational $m\times m$ matrix $M$, and edge $i$ carries $A_i=M_{\mathrm{head}(i)}-M_{\mathrm{tail}(i)}$, with $s=\sum_i\operatorname{rank}A_i$. The shear contract: input wire $w$ ends at output role $\rho(w)$, with $M_{\mathrm{out}(\rho(w))}-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}=I_m$ (the identity), and $s<Wm$ ([rank deficit](subspace-labels.md)); take $\tau$ with $s/W<m^\tau$.

Let $\Phi_M$ move the entry at address $(H,D)$ to $(H+MD,D)$. For another matrix $M'$, $\Phi_{M'}\Phi_M=\Phi_{M'+M}$. The [frame](array-frames.md) at a vertex with matrix $M$ is $\Phi_M$; an edge to a vertex with matrix $M'$ changes it by $\Phi_{M'-M}=\Phi_{A_i}$. A common address permutation commutes with every pointwise bit gate. [Matrix shear by triangular factorization](matrix-shear.md) performs each $\Phi_{A_i}$: rank $a$ costs $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields <cite data-source="paper">An edge matrix of rank $a$ will require $a$ smaller interchanges.</cite>, so there are exactly $s$ smaller calls <cite data-source="paper">The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$.</cite>.

Suppose a row field ahead of both chunks has length divisible by $W^k$. Within each prefix, rows are split into role streams by [stream scans](stream-ops.md): row $Wx+w-1$ goes to stream $w$ as row $x$. Each stream has volume $V/W$ and row count divisible by $W^{k-1}$. Read wire $w$'s input $f_w$ as the logical array $\Phi_{-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}}f_w$. By the composition rule and the contract, the output is $f'_{\rho(w)}=\Phi_{M_{\mathrm{out}(\rho(w))}}\Phi_{-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}}f_w=\Phi_{I_m}f_w$. Merging rows back undoes $\rho$, giving $H\gets H+D$ on every original row.

Each call acts on volume $V/W$; other work is $O(V)$. The time per unit volume $F_k$ at width $m^k$ obeys $F_0=O(1)$, $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$, the recurrence of [Recursive power saving](rank-recurrence.md). Unrolled over levels $j$, $F_k=O(\sum_{j=0}^k (s/W)^j)$. If $s/W\le1$ this is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; otherwise it is $O((s/W)^k)$, below $m^{k\tau}$. So $F_k=O(e^\tau)$. As $s/W$ nears $m$, $\tau\approx1$.

For large $e$, put $k'=\lceil\log_m e\rceil$ and $\nu=\lceil k'\log W/(2\log q)\rceil$, so $q^{2\nu}\ge W^{k'}$, $1\le\nu<e$ and $\nu=O(\log 2e)$; small $e$ use single-digit interchanges. Split each chunk into top $\nu$ digits and rest, $h^+,h^-$ and $d^+,d^-$. Interchange the high digits and move $h^+$ next to $d^+$: $(h^+,h^-,g,d^+,d^-)$ becomes $(d^+,h^+,h^-,g,d^-)$. Now $d^+,h^+$ form a row field of range $\Lambda=q^{2\nu}\ge W^{k'}$ before both remaining chunks. Pad with zero rows to $\Lambda'=W^{k'}\lceil \Lambda/W^{k'}\rceil<2\Lambda$ rows (volume below $2V$). Write $e-\nu=\sum_{j=0}^{k'}a_jm^j$, $0\le a_j<m$. Split each remaining chunk into $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$ and interchange corresponding pieces as above. The total $O(V)\sum_ja_jm^{j\tau}\le O(V)\,m\sum_jm^{j\tau}=O(Ve^\tau)$, since $m^{k'}<me$. Scan away padded rows and reverse the joining, giving $(d^+,d^-,g,h^+,h^-)$ at cost $O(V\nu)=O(Ve^\tau)$.

For $u$-bit chunks, pad $[2^u]$ to $[q^e]$, $e$ least with $q^e\ge2^u$, and scan the padding away. Since $e=O(u)$ the cost is $O(Vu^\tau)$ <cite data-source="paper">Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is $O(Vu^\tau)$.</cite>.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0173-write-address-interchange.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0173-write-address-interchange.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0173-write-address-interchange` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0173-write-address-interchange`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
