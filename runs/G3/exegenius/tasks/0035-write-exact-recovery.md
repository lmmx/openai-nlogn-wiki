# exegenius task 0035-write-exact-recovery

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Exact recovery by rounding and carries
Gloss: Because the accumulated numerical error on every recovered coefficient is below 1/2, rounding gives the exact integer convolution coefficients, and radix-2^b carry propagation yields the 2n-bit product.

## This page in the argument

The step: The accumulated numerical error on every recovered coefficient is below $1/2$, so rounding gives the exact integer convolution coefficients and radix-$2^b$ carry propagation yields the $2n$-bit product.
How: Follow the norm and the error of the computed arrays through every step using contraction and bilinear-contraction bounds, then bound the error after the final rescaling and round.
Why: An error strictly below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer the unique correct coefficient, since the true coefficients are integers. (the sources say so: "The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to" (paper))
Striking feature: The error stays below $1/2$ even after amplification by $2^\gamma$, $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$, because the working precision $p=6b$ leaves a factor $2^{-6b}$ against a total amplification of only about $2^{2b+\gamma}T^2L$ with $\gamma=o(b)$. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The error of a normalized ring convolution, a complex convolution and a chirp transform is less than $5TL$, $6TL$ and $8TL$ units of $2^{-p}$ respectively, where $L=\log_2T$.
- The source transform has error less than $E_s 2^{-p}$ with $E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL$ and keeps all values in the unit disk.
- After the second pointwise product and the opposite transform, the scaled array $\widetilde w$ approximates $(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_w 2^{-p}$, where $E_w<28\,2^\gamma T^2L$.
- After the final scaling by $2^{2b+4}S$ the absolute error on every coefficient is less than $448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$.
- Radix-$2^b$ carry propagation with carries below $2^{2b}$ yields the product bits, and the product is less than $2^{2n}$, so exactly $2n$ bits are output.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of radix digits, evaluate it with Fourier-type transforms whose data movement and butterfly layers are accelerated by two power-saving tape procedures, recover the exact integers by rounding and carries, and add up the costs. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The algorithm converts the inputs to radix-$2^b$ digit lists, maps them by the Chinese-remainder address map, applies the resampled chirp source transform to each, multiplies pointwise, applies the opposite transform, rescales, rounds, undoes the address map and propagates carries, giving the exact $2n$-bit product.; how: Choose the parameters, express the product as a cyclic convolution of digit lists on prime axes, evaluate that convolution through resampling, the chirp identity and the ring convolution after a phase twist, then recover exact integers by rounding and carries. (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S5.7.1, S5.7.2, S5.7.3, S5.7.4, S5.7.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S5.7.1**: The error of a normalized ring convolution, a complex convolution and a chirp transform is less than $5TL$, $6TL$ and $8TL$ units of $2^{-p}$ respectively, where $L=\log_2T$.
Source: "<(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p." (paper)
> To compare it with $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)$, insert the exact normalized $\mathcal M_r$ at $\iota f'$ and $\iota g'$. Its bilinear contraction bound propagates the two input twist errors, each less than $4$. Its approximation contributes $E_{\rm ring}$, and the output untwist contributes less than $4$. All these comparisons are at the normalized $\mathcal M_r$ interface, after its factor $M$. They give \[ \|\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(f,g) -\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)\| <(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p. \]

**S5.7.2**: The source transform has error less than $E_s 2^{-p}$ with $E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL$ and keeps all values in the unit disk.
Source: "E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL," (paper)
> Finally let the input to a source transform have norm at most $.5$. The computed expansion has error less than $dp^2$ and norm less than $.5+dp^2h_p<.51$. It is therefore a permitted chirp input. The chirp output is in the disk by the preceding argument, so each compression call is defined and returns another disk-grid array. Insert the exact contractions $\mathcal A$, $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, and $\mathcal B_0$ at the computed inputs. The error before the source scale is less than $2dp^2+8TL$. Multiplication by $2^\gamma$ therefore gives error less than $2^\gamma(2dp^2+8TL)h_p$, which is bounded by $E_sh_p$ with \begin{equation}\label{eq:source-error} E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL, \end{equation} because $2dp^2<TL$ eventually. The exact source transform $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ is a contraction, so the scaled approximation has norm at most $.5+E_sh_p<.501$. Its exact numerator scaling therefore also leaves a disk-grid output without clipping. Conjugation preserves the grid and norm, so the opposite procedure has the same error and disk guarantee. All these margins may be enforced by one fixed cutoff. For example, $b\ge2^{24}$, together with the other eventual construction conditions, makes $dp^2h_p$, $8TLh_p$, $E_sh_p$ and $28\,2^\gamma T^2Lh_p$ smaller than $10^{-3}$.

**S5.7.3**: After the second pointwise product and the opposite transform, the scaled array $\widetilde w$ approximates $(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_w 2^{-p}$, where $E_w<28\,2^\gamma T^2L$.
Source: "E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\,2^\gamma T^2L." (paper)
> Let $G:=RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$ be the exact opposite contraction. Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}, applied to $U=RF_{\boldsymbol s}u$ and $V_1=RF_{\boldsymbol s}v$, gives \[ G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2. \] The computed opposite transform may be applied to $z$ because $\|z\|<.5$. Insert $G$ at that computed input: \[ \begin{aligned} \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-G(U\cdot V_1)\| &\le \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-Gz\|\\ &\qquad+\|G(z-U\cdot V_1)\|\\ &<(3E_s+2)h_p. \end{aligned} \] The first exact numerator multiplication by $S$ gives $\widetilde w$, approximating $w=(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_wh_p$, where \[ E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\,2^\gamma T^2L. \] Each coefficient of $w$ is an average of $S$ products of coefficients of $u$ and $v$, so $\|w\|<1/16$. The earlier cutoff therefore gives \[ \|\widetilde w\|<1/16+E_wh_p<1/16+10^{-3}<1. \] This proves the disk bound for the computed first scaled result.

**S5.7.4**: After the final scaling by $2^{2b+4}S$ the absolute error on every coefficient is less than $448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$.
Source: "\le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12." (paper)
> In tensor order, the unscaled integer coefficient array is $2^{2b+4}S w$. This second occurrence of $S$ reverses the normalization still present in $w$, and $2^{2b+4}$ reverses the two input scales. Both multiplications act exactly on grid numerators. Since $S\le T<2^b$ and $L<b$ eventually, the final absolute error is less than \begin{equation}\label{eq:final-error} 2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\,2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b} <448b\,2^{-b+\gamma} \le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12. \end{equation} The true coefficients are real integers. If $H_j$ is the real numerator after the second scaling, its represented value is $H_j/2^p$. The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to that value the unique correct coefficient.

**S5.7.5**: Radix-$2^b$ carry propagation with carries below $2^{2b}$ yields the product bits, and the product is less than $2^{2n}$, so exactly $2n$ bits are output.
Source: "than $2^{2n}$; all bits above position $2n-1$ are therefore zero." (paper)
> After $\Phi^{-1}$ the coefficients occur in increasing ordinary index, so this carry scan proceeds from least to most significant. Carry storage and work per coefficient are $O(b)$ bits and steps. Write each digit's bits from low to high on a work tape, and drain the final $O(b)$-bit carry in the same order. Copy the completed stream backward once to obtain most-significant-first order. The stream has length $O(Sb)=O(Tp)$, including chunk padding and the final carry, so this reversal is a charged linear tape pass. The exact product is less than $2^{2n}$; all bits above position $2n-1$ are therefore zero. Remove only those zero padding bits and retain leading zeros as needed to produce exactly $2n$ bits. Zero inputs obey the same invariant and output rule.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0035-write-exact-recovery.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0035-write-exact-recovery.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0035-write-exact-recovery` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0035-write-exact-recovery`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
