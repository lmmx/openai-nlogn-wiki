# exegenius task 0120-audit-cost-accounting

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

A term, symbol or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term, symbol or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- symbol: notation used without being defined on the page.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Cost accounting

Cost accounting checks that the [multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md) meets the claimed time bound. The paper writes every cost as a multiple of the stored volume $V = Tp = \Theta(n)$, using the [normalized cost](normalized-cost.md) of each operation. Each normalized cost is a fixed constant times a power of $p$ with an exponent depending on $\epsilon$, $c$, $\tau$, $\lambda'$, $\delta$.

Table 1 of the paper lists these normalized costs for the operations in the algorithm: prefix-slot moves and butterfly rounds, chunk exchanges for the transform layout, simultaneous butterfly rounds, CRT and axis layouts, Gaussian line maps, chirps and twists, packed polynomial products, final scaling, and input and output. Most rows are a power of $p$ with an exponent less than one, and two rows are logarithmic or constant.

The bound holds because every dominant exponent in the table falls below one by a margin. The paper names seven dominant margins $g_1, \dots, g_7$:

$$g_1 = 1 - \epsilon(1+c), \quad g_2 = \epsilon c (1-\tau), \quad g_3 = \epsilon(1 - \lambda'), \quad g_4 = 1 - \tau - \epsilon(2-\tau), \quad g_5 = \tfrac14 - \delta - \tfrac32\epsilon, \quad g_6 = 1 - \delta - \epsilon, \quad g_7 = \epsilon.$$

With the chosen constants, $g_2 = 2^{-75} \cdot 2^{-56} \cdot 2^{-50} = 2^{-181}$ and $g_3 = 2^{-129}$, and the others are larger. So the smallest margin is $2^{-181} = 2\kappa$.

The paper states that this explicit slack covers any remaining fixed power of $\log p$. Since $V = \Theta(n)$ and $p = \Theta(\lg n)$, where $\lg n = \log_2 n$, the total cost is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$, which is the stated bound.

The exponents come from the operations themselves. For example, the chunk exchanges use the [address-field interchange](address-interchange.md) cost $O(V u^{\tau})$, and the simultaneous rounds use the [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md) cost $O(V d^{\lambda'})$. The [recursive rank saving](rank-saving-recursion.md) is what keeps the recursive rows below the trivial bound. The choice of constants in the [parameter choice](parameter-choice.md) is what makes each margin positive.
