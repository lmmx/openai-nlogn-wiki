# exegenius task 0426-audit-limit-inferior

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Limit inferior

The limit inferior of a sequence of real numbers is the smallest value that the sequence keeps approaching as its index grows. The paper states the negation of its lower bound on multiplication time with it.

Here $k$ and $m$ are position indices on this page. Let $\chi_1, \chi_2, \chi_3, \dots$ be a sequence of real numbers, where $\chi_k$ is the $k$-th term. For each position $m$, let $\tau_m$ be the infimum of the terms from position $m$ on: the largest number that is at most every term $\chi_k$ with $k \ge m$. The infimum over fewer terms never decreases as $m$ grows. The limit inferior takes its values in the [extended real numbers](extended-reals.md), and it is $-\infty$ when the terms are unbounded below. It is the limit of this sequence:
$$\liminf_{k\to\infty} \chi_k = \lim_{m\to\infty} \tau_m.$$

For example, if $\chi_k = (-1)^k + 1/k$, every tail has infimum $-1$, so $\liminf_{k\to\infty} \chi_k = -1$.

**Zero limit inferior for nonnegative sequences.** Suppose every $\chi_k \ge 0$, and let $\varepsilon$ be a positive real tolerance. Then $\liminf_{k\to\infty} \chi_k = 0$ exactly when for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there are infinitely many $k$ with $\chi_k < \varepsilon$. The reason: each $\tau_m$ is nonnegative and nondecreasing, so the limit is $0$ exactly when $\tau_m = 0$ for every $m$. And $\tau_m = 0$ means no positive number is a lower bound of the tail, that is, for each $\varepsilon > 0$ some $k \ge m$ has $\chi_k < \varepsilon$. Requiring this for every $m$ means infinitely many such $k$.

**Use in the paper.** Here $n$ is the input length in bits, and $\lg$ is the [base-2 logarithm](base-two-logarithm.md). For a fixed machine $A$, $\mathcal{T}_A(n)$ is the worst-case running time of $A$ on inputs of $n$ bits. Here $\delta_A > 0$ is a real constant and $\Gamma_A$ is a threshold on input length. The [n log n optimality conjecture](n-log-n-conjecture.md) says that for each fixed machine $A$ there are such constants, with
$$\mathcal{T}_A(n) \ge \delta_A\, n\lg n \quad \text{whenever } n \ge \Gamma_A.$$
The paper states it as.

The limit inferior is applied to the ratio of time to the [Schönhage–Strassen bound](schonhage-strassen.md) $n\lg n$, that is, to $\mathcal{T}_A(n)/(n\lg n)$. The negation for $A$ says that for every $\delta > 0$ and every threshold $\Gamma$, some $n \ge \Gamma$ has $\mathcal{T}_A(n) < \delta\, n\lg n$. The ratio is nonnegative for $n \ge 2$, so this says the ratio falls below every $\delta > 0$ infinitely often: $\liminf_{n\to\infty} \mathcal{T}_A(n)/(n\lg n) = 0$. The paper states it as

The main theorem, on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md), gives one machine $A$ with a time bound. Here $\kappa = 2^{-182}$ is a fixed exponent with $0 < \kappa < 1$, and $C$ is a constant: $\mathcal{T}_A(n) \le C\, n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa}$ for all large $n$. This page uses that bound without proving it:.

Dividing by $n\lg n$ gives $0 \le \mathcal{T}_A(n)/(n\lg n) \le C(\lg n)^{-\kappa}$. Since $\kappa > 0$ and $\lg n \to \infty$, the right side tends to zero, so the ratio's limit, and its limit inferior, is zero. This refutes the conjecture:.
