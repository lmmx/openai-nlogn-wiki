# exegenius task 0024-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/D5` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Fast simultaneous butterfly layer
Gloss: Applying the H_0 butterfly on the same bit position of d address chunks at once, using phase frames, binary changes of basis by chunk moves and the recursive saving, in time O(V d^λ') instead of d whole-array passes.
Heading: Simultaneous butterfly layer in time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $V$ (stored bit volume): The number of stored data bits in the array.
- $d$ (number of chunks): The number of equal-width address chunks (axes) whose selected bit gets a butterfly simultaneously.
- $\lambda'$ (layer exponent): A fixed constant strictly less than one controlling the cost.

## This page in the argument

The step: A normalized butterfly layer on the same bit position of $d$ address chunks costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ instead of $d$ whole-array passes.
How: reuse the recursive saving on the complex phase network, with chunk moves for changes of basis
Why: Separate butterfly factors would need $d$ whole-array passes; the same network trick that speeds the interchange gives a sub-linear cost in $d$ for a simultaneous layer. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Phase frames express a tensor product of the two-point kernel $C$ on selected bits through smaller groups and binary changes of basis.
- Selected address bits can be changed by packed additions on a rectangle, with exceptional addresses repaired by sorting.
- Applying $H_0$ simultaneously on the same bit of $d$ address chunks costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with one truncation after the contractive layer.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic fixed multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce multiplication to a convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ via CRT, Gaussian resampling, chirps and a twist, and evaluate its transforms with fast interchange and butterfly layers (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures, fast address interchange and fast simultaneous butterfly layers, make address movement and Fourier layers cost less than a full scan per level.; how: build the elementary scans, then the network-based recursive saving, then the two accelerated procedures

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.5.1, S1.5.2, S1.5.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.5.1**: Phase frames express a tensor product of the two-point kernel $C$ on selected bits through smaller groups and binary changes of basis.
Source: "We first construct tensor products of the auxiliary two-point kernel" (paper)
> We first construct tensor products of the auxiliary two-point kernel $C$ from Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface}. Its phase frames express a $C$ tensor product using smaller groups of selected bits, separated by binary changes of basis. We implement those changes by moving whole address chunks. Splitting complete rows among the network's wire roles then reduces the volume of each recursive call. Finally, we bound the intermediate dyadic values and convert the completed $C$ layer to the normalized $H_0$ layer. The entire layer is evaluated exactly before one final truncation.

**S1.5.2**: Selected address bits can be changed by packed additions on a rectangle, with exceptional addresses repaired by sorting.
Source: "\begin{lemma}[Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle]" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle] \label{lem:packed-selected-bit-rectangle} Let $R\ge1$, $K\ge6$, $f\ge1$, $L=fK$, and $0\le\rho<K$. Let $N_0,N_1,N_2,N_3$ be positive integers, and let $(\chi_1,\chi_2,\chi_3)$ be a permutation of $(x,y,z)$. Consider $R$-bit records in lexicographic order on \[ [N_0]\times[2^L]_{\chi_1}\times[N_1]\times[2^L]_{\chi_2} \times[N_2]\times[2^L]_{\chi_3}\times[N_3]. \] The subscript names the chunk at that position. The input supplies $N_0,\ldots,N_3,R,K,f,\rho$ as a fixed number of canonical binary integers, together with the finite permutation of the chunk names, as in Section~\ref{sec:streams}. Put \[ M=2^{3L}\prod_{h=0}^3N_h,\qquad V=MR,\qquad A_{\rm rect}=\lceil\log_2(2V)\rceil. \] At the selected positions

**S1.5.3**: Applying $H_0$ simultaneously on the same bit of $d$ address chunks costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with one truncation after the contractive layer.
Source: "\begin{proposition}[Simultaneous normalized butterfly layer]" (paper)
> \begin{proposition}[Simultaneous normalized butterfly layer] \label{prop:simultaneous-layer} Fix \[ \tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50},\qquad \beta=\frac12,\qquad C_1=20. \] Let $c,\epsilon,\lambda,\lambda'$ be fixed positive rational numbers satisfying \[ \max\{\tau,\sigma\}<\lambda<1,\qquad \tau(1+c/\beta)<\lambda,\qquad \max\{\lambda,\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)\}<\lambda'<1, \qquad \epsilon C_1<1. \] Fix positive constants $a_d\le b_d$ and $a_r\le b_r$, and fix positive constants $C_M,C_{\rm desc},C_w$ with $C_w>1$. For these fixed choices there are a cutoff $p_0$, one fixed finite-alphabet multitape procedure, and an implicit time constant with the following guarantee. The cutoff and time constant may depend on the fixed rational parameters and these constants. For every choice

### Other pages these steps use

Link each where the derivation uses it, stating what it gives; do not derive its results again.

- [Linear networks with frames](linear-network-frames.md)
- [Array order and elementary stream operations](stream-scans.md)
- [Controlled shifts and rational scalings](controlled-shifts.md)

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Recursive power saving](recursive-saving.md): A call at parameter mf uses s < Wm calls at parameter f on streams of volume V/W, so the per-volume cost grows by a factor s/W < m when the parameter is multiplied by m, giving cost V·e^τ with τ<1.
  Shown as: Fast simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Recursive power saving
- [Fast address-field interchange](address-interchange.md): Interchange of two disjoint contiguous address fields of u digits in time O(V u^τ) with a fixed τ<1, via XOR combinations of intermediate streams that finally give an exact permutation for arbitrary auxiliary values.
  Shown as: Fast simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Fast address-field interchange
- [FFT butterflies](fft-butterfly.md): A two-point butterfly combines two values u,v into (u+v)/2 and (u-v)/2; an FFT is built from layers of these acting on address bits, one layer per level, so scanning the array at each level costs n log n.
  Shown as: Fast simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* FFT butterflies
- [Dyadic fixed-point arithmetic and rounding](fixed-point-precision.md): Complex coefficients stored as fixed-point Gaussian dyadics with p fractional bits; exact intermediate values, a single truncation after contractive layers, and error tracking so the final coefficient error is below 1/2.
  Shown as: Fast simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Dyadic fixed-point arithmetic and rounding
- [Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1](negacyclic-ring.md): Complex polynomials of degree below r with multiplication reduced by y^r = −1; powers of y act as roots of unity and multiplying by one is a signed shift of the coefficient list.
  Shown as: Fast simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1

## Pages that build on this one

- Synthetic transform layout and convolution cost: Arranging the array so the simultaneous layers apply with frequency order retained, giving a convolution over the ring from two forward transforms, a pointwise product (via signed packing) and an opposite transform at cost O(Tp[dK+pK^{τ-1}+ℓd^{λ'}+log(rp)]).

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a" (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.
