# exegenius task 0040-write-crt-map

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/Q1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, binomial counting, permutations, induction, graphs, the union bound, and elementary number theory with gcd, primes, modular inverses and the Chinese remainder theorem), an algorithms course (asymptotic notation, recurrences and geometric sums, divide and conquer including Karatsuba, sorting including radix sort, stacks, amortized counters, the RAM model and worst-case running time), and an introductory theory course with Turing machines and multitape tapes. From computer organization they know binary and two's-complement encodings, bit order, XOR and binary arithmetic; from calculus and a first linear-algebra course they know logarithms, exponentials, Newton's method, simple inequalities, complex numbers with conjugates, polynomials, matrices, Gaussian elimination, rank, dot products, projections and eigenvalues over the real or rational numbers.

## This page

Concept: Chinese-remainder convolution map
Gloss: The Agarwal–Cooley isomorphism ℂ[x]/(x^S − 1) → ⊗ᵢ ℂ[xᵢ]/(xᵢ^{sᵢ} − 1) for pairwise coprime sᵢ, placing the digit list on a product of prime cyclic axes and implemented on tape by triangular controlled shifts and axis moves.
Also called: Agarwal–Cooley map, CRT map

## This page in the argument

The step: The map $\Phi:x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$ is a convolution-preserving isomorphism $\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\to\bigotimes_i\mathbb C[x_i]/(x_i^{s_i}-1)$, and it, its inverse and their padding cost $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ on tape.
How: Write each coefficient index in mixed radix, compute the axis coordinates by the triangular formula $b_i=a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j \bmod s_i$, and realize it by prefix-controlled cyclic shifts after reversing the axis order with chunk interchanges.
Why: Choosing coordinate powers that make the Chinese-remainder change of order triangular turns it into a sequence of controlled cyclic shifts, each linear-time. (the sources say so: "The following map uses that
algebraic split, with coordinate powers that make the change of order a
sequence of controlled cyclic shifts." (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The image of $x$ has order $S$, so its powers run through all target monomials once, and $\Phi$ is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution.
- The axis-$i$ coordinate of $\Phi(x^k)$ is $a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j \bmod s_i$, depending only on lower-index digits.
- Each triangular step is a bijection of the padded box preserving the valid set, so zero padding stays zero.
- With $O(d^2)$ axis moves by chunk interchange, $\Phi$, its inverse and their padding cost $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine computes the exact $2n$-bit product of two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to radix-digit convolution, move it by a Chinese-remainder map, Gaussian resampling, chirps and a phase twist to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ computed by synthetic transforms; speed up the transforms' address movement and butterfly layers with two network-based tape procedures; then prove exact recovery and total the costs.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S9.1, S9.2, S9.3, S9.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S9.1**: The image of $x$ has order $S$, so its powers run through all target monomials once, and $\Phi$ is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution.
Source: "Hence
$\Phi$ is an isomorphism and preserves cyclic convolution." (paper)
> Let $s_1,\ldots,s_d$ be the pairwise coprime source lengths, let $S=\prod_i s_i$, and put \[ P_i=\prod_{j<i}s_j,\qquad \mu_i=P_i^{-1}\pmod{s_i}. \] Here $P_i$ denotes an integer prefix product, not a Fourier-coordinate permutation. The assignment \[ \Phi:\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\longrightarrow \mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_d]/(x_1^{s_1}-1,\ldots,x_d^{s_d}-1), \qquad x\longmapsto\prod_i x_i^{\mu_i} \] respects $x^S=1$, so it defines an algebra map. The target monomial group has size $S$, and the image of $x$ has order $S$, because each $\mu_i$ is a unit and the $s_i$ are pairwise coprime. Its powers therefore run through all target basis monomials exactly once. Hence $\Phi$ is an isomorphism and preserves cyclic convolution.

**S9.2**: The axis-$i$ coordinate of $\Phi(x^k)$ is $a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j \bmod s_i$, depending only on lower-index digits.
Source: "Indeed terms with $j>i$ are divisible by $s_i$, and $\mu_iP_i=1$ modulo
$s_i$." (paper)
> Every ordinary coefficient index has a unique mixed-radix expression \[ k=\sum_{j=1}^d a_jP_j,\qquad 0\le a_j<s_j. \] The coordinate of $\Phi(x^k)$ in axis $i$ is \begin{equation}\label{eq:triangular-crt} b_i=a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j\pmod{s_i}. \end{equation} Indeed terms with $j>i$ are divisible by $s_i$, and $\mu_iP_i=1$ modulo $s_i$. Numerical order of $k$ is lexicographic order of $(a_d,\ldots,a_1)$. Insert the padding in one nested scan of the full box $\prod_i[0,t_i)$ in this lexicographic order, with $a_d$ the outermost counter and $a_1$ the innermost. At an address satisfying $a_i<s_i$ for every $i$, copy the next original coefficient record; at every other address, write a zero record. The valid addresses occur in the original coefficient order, so each record is copied to its intended mixed-radix address. To delete the padding after the inverse axis reorder, use the same enumeration, copying the record at each valid address and skipping the record at each invalid address.

**S9.3**: Each triangular step is a bijection of the padded box preserving the valid set, so zero padding stays zero.
Source: "Consequently
zero padding remains zero after every step." (paper)
> To specify the action on padded addresses, let \[ \mathcal P=\prod_i[0,t_i),\qquad \mathcal V=\prod_i[0,s_i) \] be sets of integer addresses. On a fixed control prefix, rotate the valid target interval $[0,s_i)$ by the offset in \eqref{eq:triangular-crt} and fix $[s_i,t_i)$. If any lower-index control is invalid, use the identity. This defines a bijection of $\mathcal P$: for fixed controls and spectators it is a cyclic permutation of the valid target interval and the identity elsewhere. Each step preserves $\mathcal V$ and its complement. Consequently zero padding remains zero after every step. An inverse is explicit: process $i=1,\ldots,d$, subtracting the same expression formed from the already recovered lower coordinates; then undo the axis reorder and perform the deletion scan just described.

**S9.4**: With $O(d^2)$ axis moves by chunk interchange, $\Phi$, its inverse and their padding cost $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$.
Source: "Therefore the map $\Phi$, its inverse, and
their padding operations cost" (paper)
> The axis widths are $\ell$ or $\ell-1$. To exchange two adjacent axes of unequal width, move the longer axis's leading bit outside their equal-width pair, swap that pair by the proved chunk-swap procedure, and put the leading bit at its new position. This adds a fixed number of linear passes to the equal-width swap cost. Reversing all axes uses $O(d^2)$ such moves. Therefore the map $\Phi$, its inverse, and their padding operations cost \[ O\bigl(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau)\bigr). \] This construction describes payload movement from address $a$ to its new address. It is distinct from the operator convention $(R_cz)_j=z_{cj}$ used for Fourier dilations, which moves a payload from address $j$ to $c^{-1}j$.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "the radix-digit coefficient list is placed on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map that preserves convolution" (paper)

  > The remaining proof places these procedures inside the multiplication reduction and accounts for every change of representation. First, the radix-digit coefficient list is placed on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map that preserves convolution. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} implements this map through triangular controlled shifts and charged axis moves. Gaussian resampling then expresses each source Fourier transform through a power-of-two tensor transform. Section~\ref{sec:resampling} retains the source and target coordinate permutations in the transform identity, so they need not be executed as separate full sorts.

- "Agarwal and Cooley used the Chinese remainder theorem to convert one cyclic convolution into multidimensional cyclic convolution" (paper)

  > To use the source tensor, we first place the ordinary coefficient stream in its tensor order. Agarwal and Cooley used the Chinese remainder theorem to convert one cyclic convolution into multidimensional cyclic convolution~\cite{AgarwalCooley1977}. The following map uses that algebraic split, with coordinate powers that make the change of order a sequence of controlled cyclic shifts.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0040-write-crt-map.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0040-write-crt-map.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0040-write-crt-map` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0040-write-crt-map`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
