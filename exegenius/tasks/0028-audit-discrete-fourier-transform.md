# exegenius task 0028-audit-discrete-fourier-transform

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source, which the reader can consult: it is followable by reference, so do not report it as a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Discrete Fourier transform

The discrete Fourier transform is built as a [Linear map](linear-map.md) that sends a vector of complex numbers to another vector of the same length. It reduces [Radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md) to pointwise products of transformed vectors.

Let $q$ be the number of values in each vector. Let $\omega$ be a primitive $q$-th root of unity: $\omega^q=1$, and $\omega^m\neq 1$ for each integer exponent $m$ with $0<m<q$. Write $j$ and $k$ for the input and output positions, each running from $0$ to $q-1$. Write $u=(u_0,\dots,u_{q-1})$ for a vector of $q$ values, and $F_q$ for the transform map:

$$(F_q u)_k=\frac{1}{q}\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}\omega^{jk}u_j.$$

The opposite transform $F_q^+$ replaces $\omega$ by $\omega^{-1}$. Applying $F_q^+$ after $F_q$ gives $u/q$, not $u$, because a sum of powers of $\omega$ over one full period is $q$ when the exponent is a multiple of $q$ and $0$ otherwise.

For vectors $u$ and $v$, the cyclic convolution $u*v$ is defined by $(u*v)_k=\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j\,v_{(k-j)\bmod q}$. Writing $\cdot$ for the entrywise product,

$$F_q^+\big((F_q u)\cdot(F_q v)\big)=\frac{u*v}{q^2}.$$

Expanding the sums, the powers of $\omega$ cancel except for products of entries whose positions add to $k$ modulo $q$; the three factors $1/q$ and the surviving full-period sum, which contributes $q$, leave $1/q^2$.

The paper fixes where each transformed entry is stored (cited), and the opposite transform reads entries in that same order.
