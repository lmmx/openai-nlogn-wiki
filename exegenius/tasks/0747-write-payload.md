# exegenius task 0747-write-payload

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

The reader already understands these concepts:

- Big-O notation
- Polynomials
- Complex numbers
- Turing machines and tapes (also: multitape Turing machine)
- Exact integer multiplication (also: exact multiplication, Binary product)
- Convolution
- Running time cost (also: cost, linear-cost update, bit-complexity bound, linear tape time)
- Logarithm (also: logarithm lg)
- Base-2 logarithm (also: logarithm and ceiling)
- Integer

## This page

Concept: Payload
Gloss: The record data carried at each address of an array, as distinct from the address that locates it.
Also called: record

## Where the argument relies on this page

- The total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s < Wm$, so each recursive level saves a strict power. (on [Rank-saving recursion](rank-saving-recursion.md))

## Evidence from the sources

- "over all payloads." (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The quotation does not support the claim it is attached to (unsupported): "In the paper's asymptotic regime the bound holds" cites "uniformly over the permitted lengths and payloads in the fixed family.": The quotation concerns uniformity over permitted lengths and payloads in a fixed family; it never mentions an asymptotic regime or says the bound holds there. Say only what the source supports, or cite the passage that supports the claim.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 284 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 355 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

A *payload* is the record data stored at one address of an array, as distinct from the address that locates that record. An array is a finite collection of records, each stored at an address, and an address is a binary string (such as $01$) saying where its record sits. The payload is what the record carries. The paper's packed-bit addition step, which adds one selected bit position across several address chunks at once, moves records between addresses, so its cost bound must hold whatever data the records carry.

Take an array with four records at the two-bit addresses $00$, $01$, $10$ and $11$, carrying the payloads $5$, $0$, $3$ and $1$. Each payload is the integer value of that record's binary data, so the payloads are the integers five, zero, three and one. Swapping the two address bits sends the record at $01$ to $10$ and the record at $10$ to $01$. Afterwards address $01$ holds payload $3$ and address $10$ holds payload $0$: the payloads moved with their records, and only the addresses changed.

The step's time bound is $O(V(L^{\tau}+1))$, where $V$ is the number of bits stored in the stream, $L$ is the width of an address chunk, and $\tau$ is a fixed exponent with $0<\tau<1$. In the paper's asymptotic regime the bound holds <cite data-source="paper">uniformly over the permitted lengths and payloads in the fixed family.</cite>

The paper states this bound with the payload left arbitrary. <cite data-source="paper">The correction depends only on addresses</cite>, so the time bound is worst-case <cite data-source="paper">over all payloads.</cite> A payload can be very small: <cite data-source="paper">The general address-swap subroutine also covers one-bit payloads</cite>, so the swap cost must be bounded even when each record carries a single bit. Since the same bound must hold for a one-bit payload, the correction work cannot depend on how much data a record carries. It comes from the addresses the step touches.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:
