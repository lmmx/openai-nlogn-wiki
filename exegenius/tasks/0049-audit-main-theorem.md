Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

A term, symbol or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term, symbol or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- symbol: notation used without being defined on the page.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Deterministic O(n (lg n)^(1-kappa)) multiplication

The main theorem says that there is one deterministic Turing machine $A$, with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes, that computes the exact product of two $n$-bit integers for every $n \ge 1$. Its worst-case running time $T_A(n)$ satisfies

$$T_A(n) = O\bigl(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa}\bigr), \qquad \kappa = 2^{-182}.$$

The bound is asymptotic: $T_A(n) \le C\, n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa}$ for some constant $C$ and all sufficiently large $n$. The paper notes that the constants and thresholds in the construction are very large, so the result establishes a bit-complexity bound, not a practical algorithm.

The statement uses the [multitape Turing machine](turing-machine-model.md) model and the exact product from [exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md). Compared with the best known bound $O(n \log n)$, the factor $\log n$ is replaced by $(\log n)^{1-\kappa}$, a strict power saving.

The theorem refutes the [Schönhage–Strassen conjecture](n-log-n-conjecture.md) in this model. An eventual $\Omega(n \log n)$ lower bound for every multiplication machine would require $T_A(n)/(n \lg n)$ to stay bounded below for each fixed machine. The machine $A$ has $T_A(n)/(n \lg n) \to 0$, so the lower bound fails for it.

The proof combines the [multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md) with the [cost accounting](cost-accounting.md). The algorithm is exact for every input length, and the cost table shows that all its terms fit the bound, with the smallest margin $2\kappa$ absorbing the logarithmic factors. The [rank-saving recursion](rank-saving-recursion.md) supplies the strict inequality that produces the power saving.
