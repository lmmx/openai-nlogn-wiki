# exegenius task 0023-write-dft

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has done an undergraduate computer science degree: discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes and gcd, sets, induction, recurrences and asymptotics), basic linear algebra over the reals and complex numbers (matrices, inverses, norms), polynomials and complex roots of unity, and algorithms including divide and conquer and Karatsuba multiplication. On the machine side they know basic single- and multi-tape Turing machines and the idea of counting steps. They have not studied the Fourier transform, FFT-based multiplication, Schonhage-Strassen, Harvey-van der Hoeven, numerical error analysis, abstract algebra beyond rings of residues, finite-field linear algebra, or any lower-bound or advanced tape-algorithm technique, so those must be explained.

## This page

Concept: Discrete Fourier transform
Gloss: The normalized transform (F_q u)_k = (1/q) Σ u_j e^{−2πijk/q}, which turns convolution into pointwise multiplication.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in that model. (on [Sub-n log n integer multiplication](sub-nlogn-multiplication.md))
- The source transform of pairwise coprime lengths $s_i$ equals $RF_{\boldsymbol s}=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A$ for power-of-two lengths $t_i$, with $\mathcal A,\mathcal B_0$ contractions applied along each axis of the padded box in $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ time, plus $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ to expose axes. (on [Multidimensional resampling on a padded box](tensor-resampling.md))
- For coprime $s<t$ with $t/s-1>p/\alpha^4$ there are linear contractions $A,B_0$ with $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$, computable to error below $p^2$ in time $O(tp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- The source coordinate permutation $R$ retained from resampling cancels across the two forward transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite-sign transform: $RF^+_{\boldsymbol s}[(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\cdot(RF_{\boldsymbol s}v)]=(u*v)/S^2$. (on [Source permutation cancellation](permutation-cancellation.md))
- The algorithm maps the digit polynomials by the Chinese-remainder map to prime axes, transforms them by resampling plus chirp convolution, multiplies pointwise, applies the opposite transform, rescales, rounds and propagates carries. (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Convolution](convolution.md): The product of two coefficient lists, cyclic when indices wrap around modulo the length, equal to polynomial multiplication modulo x^S − 1.
  Shown as: Discrete Fourier transform *<predicate>* Convolution

## Pages that build on this one

- Radix-2 butterflies and FFT: Computing a power-of-two transform by repeated two-point butterflies (u,v) ↦ ((u+v)/2,(u−v)/2) followed by twiddle multiplications and smaller transforms (decimation in frequency).
- Bluestein chirp identity: Writing a Fourier transform (with its target permutation) as a pointwise chirp phase, a cyclic convolution with the chirp, and another chirp phase.
- Gaussian resampling: Relating a Fourier transform of coprime length s to one of larger power-of-two length t via Gaussian-weighted contractions A and B_0, as P_sF_s = 2^{2α²} B_0 P_t F_t A.
- Source permutation cancellation: The coordinate permutation retained from resampling cancels across the two forward transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite-sign transform, leaving (u*v)/S².

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "(F_q u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{-2\pi i jk/q}," (paper)

  > For an integer $q\geq 1$, write \[ (F_q u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{-2\pi i jk/q}, \qquad (F_q^+ u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{2\pi i jk/q}. \] All subscripts on a vector of length $q$ are taken modulo $q$. The vector norm is the maximum modulus of its coordinates. All operator norms are induced by this norm: $\|L\|=\sup_{\|u\|\leq1}\|Lu\|$. Each normalized Fourier transform above is a contraction, since each output averages inputs multiplied by complex numbers of modulus one. Coordinate permutations preserve the norm. For an integer precision $p\geq1$, put \[ \mathbb D_p=\{2^{-p}(a+ib):a,b\in\mathbb Z,\ a^2+b^2\leq 2^{2p}\}. \] For storage between completed scalar routines, put $w_{\rm c}=p+2$. Represent $2^{-p}(a+ib)\in\mathbb D_p$ by a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit two's-complement word for

- "The normalized convolution rule is" (paper)

  > ourier sum gives \[ (F_q^+R_cz)_j =\frac1q\sum_{h=0}^{q-1}z_h e^{2\pi i h c^{-1}j/q} =(R_c^{-1}F_q^+z)_j. \] Each $t_i$ is a unit modulo $s_i$, so tensoring this identity gives $F_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=R^{-1}F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$ and hence $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+R=F_{\boldsymbol s}^+$. Also $(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot}(RF_{\boldsymbol s}v) =R(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot}F_{\boldsymbol s}v)$, because a coordinate permutation commutes with pointwise products. Therefore \[ RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+\bigl[R(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot} F_{\boldsymbol s}v)\bigr] =F_{\boldsymbol s}^+(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot} F_{\boldsymbol s}v). \] The normalized convolution rule is $F_{\boldsymbol s}(u*v)=S(F_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot} (F_{\boldsymbol s}v)$, while $F_{\boldsymbol s}^+F_{\boldsymbol s}=I/S$. The two normalizations give \[ F_{\boldsymbol s}^+ (F_{\boldsymbol s}u\mathbin{\cdot}F_{\boldsymbol s}v) =\frac1S F_{\boldsymbol s}^+F_{\boldsymbol s}(u*v) =\frac{u*v}{S^2}, \] proving \eqref{eq:source-permutation-cancel}. Finally, conjugation changes the negative Fourier sign to the positive one and commutes with the real permutation $R$. It preserves both the disk grid and the norm, so conjugating the input and output also preserves an algorithm's error bound. \end{proof} \section{Exact integer multiplication and its cost} \label{sec:assembly}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-dft.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-dft.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0023-write-dft` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0023-write-dft`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
