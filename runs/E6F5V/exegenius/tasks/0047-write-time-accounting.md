Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F5V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Cost table and the saving exponent κ
Gloss: Dividing each cost by V = Tp, seven dominant terms have powers of p at most 1 − 2κ below one; the smallest margin 2^{-181} fixes κ = 2^{-182}, and any polylog factor is absorbed.

## This page in the argument

The step: Dividing each cost by $V=Tp$, seven dominant terms have powers of $p$ at most $1-2\kappa$ below one; the smallest margin $2^{-181}$ fixes $\kappa=2^{-182}$, and any polylog factor is absorbed.
How: Tabulate the normalized cost of each operation as a power of $p$, take the seven dominant exponents, and compare their margins below one with $2\kappa$.
Why: Each cost is divided by the volume so its power of $p$ can be read off, and the margins below one are the savings available to $\kappa$. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: The saving $\kappa=2^{-182}$ is astronomically small: it is half the smallest of seven margins, $g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau)=2^{-75}\cdot2^{-56}\cdot2^{-50}=2^{-181}$, a product of three tiny exponents. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Costs are listed divided by $V=Tp$ in a table of normalized costs, with a fixed number of repeated transforms absorbed in constants.
- The seven dominant powers have margins $g_1,\dots,g_7$ below one.
- The smallest margin is $\min_ig_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
- The layout's $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges of width $K$ give normalized cost $O(pK^{\tau-1})$.
- Axis exposure and restoration take $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves each costing $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$.
- The Gaussian line costs sum to $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$, which is the fifth row after dividing by $V=Tp$.
- Global setup and prime search cost $o(V)$.
- Each of the seven powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually.
- The complete large-input bound is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$.
- Schoolbook multiplication below a fixed cutoff handles the finitely many small lengths, giving one machine with time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every $n$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, using fast address interchange and fast simultaneous butterfly layers inside a Gaussian-resampling, chirp and synthetic-transform reduction.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution evaluated through Gaussian-resampled, chirped synthetic transforms, make the two costly tape operations (address movement and butterfly layers) cheaper by a power of the logarithm using networks with a rank saving, and then assemble the algorithm and add up its costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Choosing compatible parameters, the radix-digit convolution is mapped to prime axes, transformed, multiplied pointwise, inverted, rescaled, rounded and carried to give the exact binary product in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.; how: Fix the parameters, place the digits on a product of prime cyclic axes, run the source transform on each operand, multiply and invert, then bound the error to round exactly and add up the costs.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S9.7.1, S9.7.2, S9.7.3, S9.7.4, S9.7.5, S9.7.6, S9.7.7, S9.7.8, S9.7.9, S9.7.10). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S9.7.1**: Costs are listed divided by $V=Tp$ in a table of normalized costs, with a fixed number of repeated transforms absorbed in constants.
Source: "Table~\ref{tab:costs} lists costs after division by $V$" (paper)
> For the cost calculation put $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$. The fixed-width coefficient formats use $\Theta(p)$ bits per coefficient, so a full padded array has $\Theta(V)$ stored bits. Table~\ref{tab:costs} lists costs after division by $V$; a fixed number of repeated transforms and convolutions is included in its constants. \begin{table}[ht] \centering \small \begin{tabular}{@{}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{.40\linewidth}ll@{}} \toprule Operation & Normalized cost & Power of $p$\\ \midrule Prefix-slot moves and individual butterfly rounds & $dK$ & $\epsilon(1+c)$\\ Chunk exchanges for transform layout & $pK^{\tau-1}$ & $1-\epsilon c(1-\tau)$\\ Simultaneous butterfly rounds & $\ell d^{\lambda'}$ & $1-\epsilon(1-\lambda')$\\ CRT and axis layouts & $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$ & $\tau+\epsilon(2-\tau)$\\ Gaussian line maps & $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$ & $3/4+\delta+3\epsilon/2$\\ Chirps, twists and scalar products & $dp^\delta$ & $\epsilon+\delta$\\ Packed polynomial products & $\log(rp)$ & $1-\epsilon$\\ Final scaling and rounding & $p^\delta$ & absorbed above\\ Input, padding, carries and output & $1$ & absorbed above\\ \bottomrule \end{tabular} \caption{Costs divided by $Tp$; each coefficient representation has $O(p)$ bits.}\label{tab:costs} \end{table}

**S9.7.2**: The seven dominant powers have margins $g_1,\dots,g_7$ below one.
Source: "The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one:" (paper)
> The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

**S9.7.3**: The smallest margin is $\min_ig_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
Source: "Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$." (paper)
> The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

**S9.7.4**: The layout's $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges of width $K$ give normalized cost $O(pK^{\tau-1})$.
Source: "O(p/K)\,K^\tau=O(pK^{\tau-1})." (paper)
> Here $d^2$ is absorbed by $d^2\ell^\tau$, and $\log(rp)=O(p^{1-\epsilon}+\log p)=O(p^{1-\epsilon})$. The first three rows are the terms in \eqref{eq:synthetic-transform-cost}. The prefix-slot moves and individual butterfly rounds in Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost} use $O(dK)$ linear scans. Its positional layout uses $O(p/K)$ exchanges of width-$K$ chunks, because $d\ell=O(p)$. Each exchange costs $O(VK^\tau)$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chunk-swap}, so the normalized total is \[ O(p/K)\,K^\tau=O(pK^{\tau-1}). \] For the at most $\ell$ simultaneous rounds, Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer} supplies $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ per round. Its bound already includes the binary basis changes, deterministic repair, row padding and removal, all base-$m$ groups, and fixed-tape cleanup.

**S9.7.5**: Axis exposure and restoration take $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves each costing $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$.
Source: "Axis exposure and restoration require $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves." (paper)
> Axis exposure and restoration require $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves. Each costs $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$: peel a single excess bit when widths differ by one, exchange their equal-width parts, and restore the bit. The $d$ CRT rotations copy valid and invalid intervals in $O(dV)$ time. Their offset setup was bounded above by $O(dTp^C/r)=o(Tp)$, using at most $T/t_i$ control prefixes for target $i$.

**S9.7.6**: The Gaussian line costs sum to $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$, which is the fifth row after dividing by $V=Tp$.
Source: "Dividing by $V=Tp$ gives the fifth row." (paper)
> For Gaussian resampling, axis $i$ has at most $T/t_i$ processed lines. The line-machine costs therefore sum to \[ \sum_{i=1}^d\frac{T}{t_i} O(t_i p^{3/2+\delta}\alpha) =O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha). \] Dividing by $V=Tp$ gives the fifth row. The factor $\alpha=\Theta(p^{1/4+\epsilon/2})$ explains its displayed power of $p$.

**S9.7.7**: Global setup and prime search cost $o(V)$.
Source: "Global setup and prime search cost $o(V)$, as proved earlier." (paper)
> Finally, all role, arithmetic, and stack tapes form fixed finite families. A child parks and restores only its parent's streams, with the stack head at the active top; copying and cleanup are charged to that logical volume. No operation repeatedly scans parked ancestors. Growing axis lists and call states are stored data, not extra tapes or alphabet symbols. Global setup and prime search cost $o(V)$, as proved earlier.

**S9.7.8**: Each of the seven powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually.
Source: "Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by" (paper)
> Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by \eqref{eq:margin-list}. Any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually. The complete large-input bound is consequently \[ O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}). \] Fix one cutoff beyond all the size, precision, margin and layout conditions, and use schoolbook multiplication below it. The finitely many smaller lengths are included by enlarging the implicit constant. With $\lg n=\max\{\lceil\log_2n\rceil,1\}$, the resulting single fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape deterministic machine has worst-case time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every input length and produces precisely the required $2n$-bit product. \section{Exact division and integer square root} \label{sec:exact-arithmetic-proof}

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$." (paper)

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0047-write-time-accounting.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0047-write-time-accounting.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0047-write-time-accounting` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0047-write-time-accounting`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
