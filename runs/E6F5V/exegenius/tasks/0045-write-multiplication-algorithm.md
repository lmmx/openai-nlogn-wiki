# exegenius task 0045-write-multiplication-algorithm

Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F5V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: The multiplication algorithm
Gloss: Split the operands into radix digits, map them by Φ to prime axes, apply the source transform to each, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, rescale by S and 2^{2b+4}, round to integers, undo Φ and propagate carries.

## This page in the argument

The step: Split the operands into radix digits, map them by $\Phi$ to the prime axes, apply the source transform to each, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, rescale by $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$, round to integers, undo $\Phi$ and propagate carries.
How: Do the digit convolution in the source frequency domain and let the retained permutation cancel between the two forward transforms and the opposite transform.
Why: The source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite-sign transform, so it never has to be executed. (the sources say so: "Finally, the source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product, and the opposite-sign transform." (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Each operand is read backward in groups of $b$ bits to give radix-$2^b$ digits, placed as grid values with zero padding.
- The coefficient-address map $\Phi$ gives the source arrays $u,v$ with coefficients of norm below $1/4$.
- The forward source transforms $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(u)$ and $\widetilde{\mathscr F}(v)$ are computed.
- Corresponding coefficients are multiplied exactly and truncated to the grid, giving the array $z$.
- The opposite transform of $z$ is computed and its numerators multiplied exactly by $S$.
- A further exact scale by $2^{2b+4}S$, rounding to integers and applying $\Phi^{-1}$ restores the integer coefficients in ordinary order.
- Radix-$2^b$ carries are propagated in increasing coefficient order to produce the $2n$ output bits.
- The two scales by $S$ undo different normalizations: after the three transforms the result is $(u*v)/S^2$, after the first scale $(u*v)/S$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, using fast address interchange and fast simultaneous butterfly layers inside a Gaussian-resampling, chirp and synthetic-transform reduction.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution evaluated through Gaussian-resampled, chirped synthetic transforms, make the two costly tape operations (address movement and butterfly layers) cheaper by a power of the logarithm using networks with a rank saving, and then assemble the algorithm and add up its costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Choosing compatible parameters, the radix-digit convolution is mapped to prime axes, transformed, multiplied pointwise, inverted, rescaled, rounded and carried to give the exact binary product in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.; how: Fix the parameters, place the digits on a product of prime cyclic axes, run the source transform on each operand, multiply and invert, then bound the error to round exactly and add up the costs.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S9.5.1, S9.5.2, S9.5.3, S9.5.4, S9.5.5, S9.5.6, S9.5.7, S9.5.8). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S9.5.1**: Each operand is read backward in groups of $b$ bits to give radix-$2^b$ digits, placed as grid values with zero padding.
Source: "Read each stored operand backward from its least significant end in groups of $b$ bits." (paper)
> The source-transform procedures now supply the three transforms needed for the radix-digit convolution. Read each stored operand backward from its least significant end in groups of $b$ bits. This produces the radix-$2^b$ digits $a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}$ in increasing coefficient order. Buffer each group on a fixed work tape and read it back most significant bit first, reversing its least-significant-first input order; pad the final short group with leading zeroes. For digit $a_j$, write the exact grid numerator $a_j2^{p-b-2}$ in a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit real word, followed by a zero $w_{\rm c}$-bit imaginary word. This exponent is nonnegative because $p=6b$, and the represented value is exactly $a_j2^{-b-2}$. Append $S-q$ zero coefficient records. Buffering and ordering the groups costs $O(n)$, including the one partial group's padding, and writing the $S$ records costs $O(Sp)$. Together with the initial count and copies, this input conversion costs $O(n+Sp)=O(Tp)$; all $n$ input bits, including leading zeroes, are retained before the final group is padded.

**S9.5.8**: The two scales by $S$ undo different normalizations: after the three transforms the result is $(u*v)/S^2$, after the first scale $(u*v)/S$.

> The two occurrences of $S$ in this algorithm undo different normalizations. By \eqref{eq:source-permutation-cancel}, the exact counterpart after the three transforms is $(u*v)/S^2$, so after the first scale it is $w=(u*v)/S$. The second scale gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$, whose inverse image under $\Phi$ is the original integer coefficient convolution. The next subsection verifies the disk bounds needed by every call and proves that the final error is less than $1/2$; it also justifies the rounding, carries, and output length.

## Pages that build on this one

- Precision and exact recovery: Disk-margin and error bookkeeping shows the recovered coefficient error stays below 1/2, so rounding gives the exact integer convolution coefficients and carries give the exact binary product.
- Cost table and the saving exponent κ: Dividing each cost by V = Tp, seven dominant terms have powers of p at most 1 − 2κ below one; the smallest margin 2^{-181} fixes κ = 2^{-182}, and any polylog factor is absorbed.
- Integer multiplication below n log n: A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two n-bit integers exactly in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) time with κ = 2^{-182}, using fast address interchange and fast simultaneous butterfly layers inside a Gaussian-resampling, chirp and synthetic-transform reduction.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0045-write-multiplication-algorithm.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0045-write-multiplication-algorithm.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0045-write-multiplication-algorithm` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0045-write-multiplication-algorithm`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
