# exegenius task 0091-write-chirp

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Bluestein chirp identity
Gloss: An identity that rewrites a (permuted) Fourier transform as a pointwise chirp phase, a cyclic convolution, and another chirp phase.
Also called: chirp transform

## This page in the argument

The step: For even $t_i$ and the chirp $a_{\boldsymbol j}=\exp(-\pi i\sum_is_ij_i^2/t_i)$ one has $QF_{\boldsymbol t}u=\overline a\cdot\bigl(a*(\overline a\cdot u)\bigr)/T$, so the target permutation $Q$ is absorbed into a cyclic convolution of length $T$ and never executed.
How: Expand the coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in the right side using $(j-k)^2=j^2-2jk+k^2$, so that the three chirp phases combine to $\exp(2\pi i\sum s_ij_ik_i/t_i)$, which is the coefficient of $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ because $Q$ reads frequency $-s_ij_i$.
Why: Bluestein's identity turns a (permuted) discrete Fourier transform into pointwise phases around a convolution; the phases depend on $s_ij_i^2/t_i$ and the permutation $Q$ merely changes which frequency is read, which the identity already includes. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Define $a_{\boldsymbol j}=\exp\left(-\pi i\sum_{i=1}^d s_ij_i^2/t_i\right)$.
- Replacing $j_i$ by $j_i+t_i$ changes the exponent by $-\pi is_i(2j_i+t_i)$, an integral multiple of $2\pi i$ because $t_i$ is even, so $a$ has period $t_i$ in coordinate $i$.
- The coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in the right side is $\frac1T\overline a_{\boldsymbol j}a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k}\overline a_{\boldsymbol k}=\frac1T\exp(2\pi i\sum_is_ij_ik_i/t_i)$.
- This is precisely the coefficient in $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, because $Q$ reads frequency $(-s_ij_i)_i$ from the negative-sign transform.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic Turing machine with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture of Sch\"onhage and Strassen in this model.; how: Build two power-saving tape procedures (chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layer) from fixed finite linear networks; use them to accelerate the synthetic polynomial transforms and ring convolution; use Gaussian resampling with retained permutations and chirps to reduce the prime-length cyclic convolution of the radix-digit coefficients to those power-of-two transforms; assemble the exact product with a proof that the error is below $1/2$; and total the cost to show a power of $\log n$ is saved. (on [Power-saving integer multiplication](main-result.md))
- The Fourier transforms of pairwise coprime prime lengths $s_i$ that the integer product needs are computed through power-of-two lengths $t_i$ by Gaussian resampling and Bluestein chirps, with the source and target coordinate permutations left inside the transform identities, so that none is executed as a sort.; how: Retain both permutations of Gaussian resampling in the transform formula: the target permutation $Q$ is absorbed by the chirp convolution, and the source permutation $R$ cancels across the two forward transforms, their pointwise product and the opposite transform. (on [Retained permutation cancellation](retained-permutations.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S4.3.1, S4.3.2, S4.3.3, S4.3.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S4.3.1**: Define $a_{\boldsymbol j}=\exp\left(-\pi i\sum_{i=1}^d s_ij_i^2/t_i\right)$.
Source: "=\exp\left(-\pi i\sum_{i=1}^d\frac{s_i j_i^2}{t_i}\right)." (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[Chirp and permutation cancellation] \label{lem:chirp-permutation} With $R,Q,s_i,t_i$ as in Lemma~\ref{lem:tensor-resampling}, assume every $t_i$ is even. For $\boldsymbol j\in\mathbb Z^d$, define \[ a_{\boldsymbol j} =\exp\left(-\pi i\sum_{i=1}^d\frac{s_i j_i^2}{t_i}\right). \] Then $a$ has period $t_i$ in coordinate $i$, and \begin{equation} QF_{\boldsymbol t}u =\overline a\mathbin{\cdot} \frac{a*(\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}u)}{T}. \label{eq:permuted-chirp} \end{equation} If $S=\prod_i s_i$, then \begin{equation} (RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+) \bigl[(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot} (RF_{\boldsymbol s}v)\bigr] =\frac{u*v}{S^2}. \label{eq:source-permutation-cancel} \end{equation} Complex conjugation of the input and output of an algorithm for $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ gives an algorithm for $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$. \end{lemma}

**S4.3.2**: Replacing $j_i$ by $j_i+t_i$ changes the exponent by $-\pi is_i(2j_i+t_i)$, an integral multiple of $2\pi i$ because $t_i$ is even, so $a$ has period $t_i$ in coordinate $i$.
Source: "Replacing $j_i$ by $j_i+t_i$ changes the exponent defining $a$ by" (paper)
> \begin{proof} Replacing $j_i$ by $j_i+t_i$ changes the exponent defining $a$ by $-\pi i s_i(2j_i+t_i)$, an integral multiple of $2\pi i$. The coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in the right side of \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp} is \[ \frac1T\overline a_{\boldsymbol j} a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k} \overline a_{\boldsymbol k} =\frac1T\exp\left(2\pi i\sum_i \frac{s_i j_i k_i}{t_i}\right). \] This is precisely the coefficient in $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, because $Q$ reads frequency $(-s_i j_i)_i$ from the negative-sign transform.

**S4.3.3**: The coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in the right side is $\frac1T\overline a_{\boldsymbol j}a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k}\overline a_{\boldsymbol k}=\frac1T\exp(2\pi i\sum_is_ij_ik_i/t_i)$.
Source: "=\frac1T\exp\left(2\pi i\sum_i" (paper)
> \begin{proof} Replacing $j_i$ by $j_i+t_i$ changes the exponent defining $a$ by $-\pi i s_i(2j_i+t_i)$, an integral multiple of $2\pi i$. The coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in the right side of \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp} is \[ \frac1T\overline a_{\boldsymbol j} a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k} \overline a_{\boldsymbol k} =\frac1T\exp\left(2\pi i\sum_i \frac{s_i j_i k_i}{t_i}\right). \] This is precisely the coefficient in $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, because $Q$ reads frequency $(-s_i j_i)_i$ from the negative-sign transform.

**S4.3.4**: This is precisely the coefficient in $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, because $Q$ reads frequency $(-s_ij_i)_i$ from the negative-sign transform.
Source: "This is precisely the coefficient in $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, because" (paper)
> \begin{proof} Replacing $j_i$ by $j_i+t_i$ changes the exponent defining $a$ by $-\pi i s_i(2j_i+t_i)$, an integral multiple of $2\pi i$. The coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in the right side of \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp} is \[ \frac1T\overline a_{\boldsymbol j} a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k} \overline a_{\boldsymbol k} =\frac1T\exp\left(2\pi i\sum_i \frac{s_i j_i k_i}{t_i}\right). \] This is precisely the coefficient in $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, because $Q$ reads frequency $(-s_i j_i)_i$ from the negative-sign transform.

## Pages that build on this one

- Retained permutation cancellation: Leaving the coordinate permutations of resampling inside the transform identity, so the source permutation cancels across the two forward transforms and the opposite one and none is executed as a sort.
- Error tracking and exact recovery: Each normalized transform and product is a contraction with a bounded rounding error, and the total error on the recovered convolution coefficients is below 1/2, so rounding gives exact integers.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform," (paper)

  > Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution. A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$; its negative wrap gives precisely the original cyclic wrap after the twist is removed. Sections~\ref{sec:synthetic-layouts} and~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products} compute convolution on the remaining axes over this polynomial ring. The two forward synthetic transforms retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes that order. Their polynomial products use signed packing and the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine.

- "Chirp and permutation cancellation" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Chirp and permutation cancellation] \label{lem:chirp-permutation} With $R,Q,s_i,t_i$ as in Lemma~\ref{lem:tensor-resampling}, assume every $t_i$ is even. For $\boldsymbol j\in\mathbb Z^d$, define \[ a_{\boldsymbol j} =\exp\left(-\pi i\sum_{i=1}^d\frac{s_i j_i^2}{t_i}\right). \] Then $a$ has period $t_i$ in coordinate $i$, and \begin{equation} QF_{\boldsymbol t}u =\overline a\mathbin{\cdot} \frac{a*(\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}u)}{T}. \label{eq:permuted-chirp} \end{equation} If $S=\prod_i s_i$, then \begin{equation} (RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+) \bigl[(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\mathbin{\cdot} (RF_{\boldsymbol s}v)\bigr] =\frac{u*v}{S^2}. \label{eq:source-permutation-cancel} \end{equation} Complex conjugation of the input and output of an algorithm for $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ gives an algorithm for $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$. \end{lemma}


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- Say what $\boldsymbol f$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "output position $\boldsymbol j$ reads frequency $\boldsymbol f=(-s_ij_i)_i$"

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 287 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 358 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

The Bluestein chirp identity rewrites a permuted [Discrete Fourier transform](dft.md) as a pointwise chirp phase, a [cyclic convolution](convolution.md), and another chirp phase, so the target permutation of resampling is absorbed into the convolution and never executed as a sort. This is how the middle transform, including its target permutation, becomes a normalized cyclic convolution <cite data-source="paper">Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform,</cite>.

Index the data by $\boldsymbol j=(j_1,\dots,j_d)$, where $d$ is the number of axes. On axis $i$, $t_i$ is the even number of entries along that axis and $s_i$ is an integer coprime to $t_i$. Put $T=\prod_i t_i$, the total number of entries. Indices along axis $i$ are taken modulo $t_i$.

The transform is $(F_{\boldsymbol t}u)_{\boldsymbol f}=\frac1T\sum_{\boldsymbol k}u_{\boldsymbol k}\exp(-2\pi i\sum_i k_if_i/t_i)$. The permutation $Q$ is the target permutation: output position $\boldsymbol j$ reads frequency $\boldsymbol f=(-s_ij_i)_i$. So in $QF_{\boldsymbol t}u$, the coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in output position $\boldsymbol j$ is $\frac1T\exp(2\pi i\sum_i s_ij_ik_i/t_i)$.

## The identity

Define the chirp $a_{\boldsymbol j}=\exp\left(-\pi i\sum_{i=1}^d s_ij_i^2/t_i\right)$, a phase quadratic in the index, and let $\overline a$ be its complex conjugate. Then
$$QF_{\boldsymbol t}u=\overline a\cdot\frac{a*(\overline a\cdot u)}{T},$$
where the dot is coordinatewise multiplication and $(f*g)_{\boldsymbol j}=\sum_{\boldsymbol k}f_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k}g_{\boldsymbol k}$ is cyclic convolution. The permuted transform is thus reduced to one [Cyclic convolution](convolution.md) of length $T$ between two pointwise phase multiplications.

## Derivation

The convolution reads $a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k}$ at indices taken modulo $t_i$, so $a$ must depend only on residues. Replacing $j_i$ by $j_i+t_i$ changes the exponent by $-\pi i s_i\frac{(j_i+t_i)^2-j_i^2}{t_i}=-\pi i s_i(2j_i+t_i)$, which is an integral multiple of $2\pi i$ because $t_i$ is even, so $a$ has period $t_i$ in coordinate $i$.

In the right side, the coefficient of $u_{\boldsymbol k}$ in output position $\boldsymbol j$ is $\frac1T\overline a_{\boldsymbol j}a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k}\overline a_{\boldsymbol k}$. Using $(j_i-k_i)^2=j_i^2-2j_ik_i+k_i^2$, the exponent of this product is $\sum_i\frac{\pi i s_i}{t_i}\bigl(j_i^2-(j_i^2-2j_ik_i+k_i^2)+k_i^2\bigr)$, where the squares cancel, so the coefficient is $\frac1T\overline a_{\boldsymbol j}a_{\boldsymbol j-\boldsymbol k}\overline a_{\boldsymbol k}=\frac1T\exp(2\pi i\sum_is_ij_ik_i/t_i)$.

This is precisely the coefficient of $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ found above, because $Q$ reads frequency $(-s_ij_i)_i$ from the negative-sign transform. The permutation needs no separate step: it only changes which frequency is read, and the sign of the cross term $2j_ik_i$ already matches it <cite data-source="paper">assume every $t_i$ is even.</cite>

For $d=1$, $t_1=2$, $s_1=1$: $a_0=1$, $a_1=-i$, and $j=k=1$ gives $\overline a_1a_0\overline a_1=i\cdot1\cdot i=-1=\exp(2\pi i\cdot\tfrac12)$, as required.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0091-write-chirp.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0091-write-chirp.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0091-write-chirp` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0091-write-chirp`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
