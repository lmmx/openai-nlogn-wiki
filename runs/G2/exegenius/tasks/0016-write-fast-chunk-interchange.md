# exegenius task 0016-write-fast-chunk-interchange

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Fast interchange of address chunks
Gloss: Swapping two disjoint contiguous address fields of u bits in an array of volume V in time O(V u^τ) for fixed τ<1, via XOR combinations of intermediate streams that finally form an exact permutation.

## This page in the argument

The step: For a fixed $\tau<1$, two disjoint contiguous address chunks of $u$ bits in an array of volume $V$ can be interchanged in $O(V u^\tau)$ time on a fixed number of tapes, although the intermediate streams are XOR combinations of the data.
How: Reduce the interchange to the shear $H\leftarrow H+D$ of the two chunks, perform that shear with the bit network by calls on smaller chunks over role streams of volume $V/W$, solve the resulting recurrence, and then remove the restrictions on width and number of rows.
Why: A call at parameter $mf$ uses only $s$ calls at parameter $f$ on streams of volume $V/W$, and $s<W m$ is what makes the cost per volume grow slower than the parameter. (the sources say so: "A recursive call at parameter $mf$ therefore uses $s$ calls at parameter" (paper))
Striking feature: The exponent $\tau$ is strictly below 1 (indeed $\tau=1-2^{-50}$), although a naive interchange of $u$ digits one at a time costs linear time in $u$ per bit. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- For a rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$, the address permutation $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ modulo $q^b$ costs exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ further work. (on [Matrix shear on address fields](matrix-shear.md))
- For $e=m^k$ digits and a row field divisible by $W^k$, interchanging two chunks of $e$ digits costs $O(V e^\tau)$, because the shear $H\leftarrow H+D$ is made of $s$ calls on $e/m$ digits, each on a role stream of volume $V/W$, and $s/W<m^\tau$ with $\tau<1$. (on [Recursive power saving from the rank deficit](recursive-power-saving.md))
- For arbitrary $u\ge1$ and arbitrary prefix, gap and suffix lengths, the interchange $(h,g,d)\mapsto(d,g,h)$ of two $u$-bit chunks of an array of volume $V$ costs $O(V u^\tau)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution over a polynomial ring computed by Fourier-type transforms; supply the two fast tape procedures that remove the logarithmic factor from address movement and from butterfly arithmetic, both obtained from linear networks that save a power; then assemble the algorithm and tally every cost. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S2.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S2.3**: For arbitrary $u\ge1$ and arbitrary prefix, gap and suffix lengths, the interchange $(h,g,d)\mapsto(d,g,h)$ of two $u$-bit chunks of an array of volume $V$ costs $O(V u^\tau)$.
How: Peel the top $\rho=O(\log u)$ digits off each chunk and exchange them one pair at a time so that they supply a row field of length divisible by $W^k$ (padding rows if needed), cover the remaining width by base-$m$ pieces handled by power-width calls, remove the padding, and handle binary widths by padding to a power of the prime $q$.
- S2.3.1: Writing each chunk as its top $\rho$ digits followed by the rest, exchanging the high digits one pair at a time and joining them produces a row field of length at least $W^k$ before both remaining chunks, at cost $O(V\rho)$.
  Source: "Write each chunk as its top $\rho$ digits followed by its remaining" (paper)
  > Write each chunk as its top $\rho$ digits followed by its remaining digits, denoted $h^+,h^-$ and $d^+,d^-$, respectively. Interchange the corresponding high digits one pair at a time. The high positions now contain $d^+$ and $h^+$; move the digits of the latter, preserving their order, into consecutive positions immediately after $d^+$. Suppressing the prefix and suffix, the field orders during the construction are \[ \begin{aligned} &(h^+,h^-,g,d^+,d^-),\\ &(d^+,h^+,h^-,g,d^-) &&\text{after exchanging and joining the high parts},\\ &(d^+,h^+,d^-,g,h^-) &&\text{after interchanging the remaining parts},\\ &(d^+,d^-,g,h^+,h^-) &&\text{after separating the high parts again}. \end{aligned} \] In the two middle orders, the first two fields form a row field of range \[ R=q^{2\rho}\ge W^k \] before both remaining chunks. The joining moves preserve the order of the remaining digits and the gap field. Exchanging and joining the high parts costs $O(V\rho)$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:elementary-streams}. Append zero rows, separately within each preceding prefix, until the row count is \[ R'=W^k\left\lceil R/W^k\right\rceil<2R. \] This changes the row field's length; it need not remain a power of $q$ during the computation. The padded logical volume is less than $2V$.
- S2.3.2: Writing the remaining width in base $m$ as $\sum_ja_jm^j$ with $a_j<m$ and applying a power-width call to each of the $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$ costs $O(V)\sum_ja_jm^{j\tau}=O(V e^\tau)$.
  Source: "Write the remaining width in base $m$:" (paper)
  > Write the remaining width in base $m$: \[ e-\rho=\sum_{j=0}^{k} a_jm^j,\qquad 0\le a_j<m. \] Partition each remaining chunk into corresponding consecutive pieces, with $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$. Apply Proposition~\ref{prop:power-interchange} to each corresponding pair. All these calls use the same row field of length $R'$, which is divisible by each required $W^j$. At completion every call preserves its row address, so it neither mixes genuine rows with padded rows nor depends on the values used for padding. The padded zero rows remain zero at these completed-call boundaries. The sum of the costs is bounded by \[ O(V)\sum_j a_jm^{j\tau}=O(Ve^\tau). \] The fixed bound $a_j<m$ and the inequality $m^k<me$ make this a geometric sum of the stated order. Scan away the padded rows, then reverse only the moves that joined the high parts. This is the last transition in the field-order display: $h^+$ returns to the later high position, while $d^+$ stays in the earlier one. The final order is therefore the required interchange of the two full chunks. The remaining movement cost $O(V\log(2e))$ is $O(Ve^\tau)$. Computing the piece list and every new shape is polynomial in $\log(2V)$ per piece. There are at most $(m-1)(k+1)=O(\log(2e))$ pieces; since $V\ge q^{2e}$, their total descriptor cost is a fixed power of $\log(2V)$ and hence $O(V)$. Each power-width call uses the fixed schedule proved above and leaves its work tapes clean.
- S2.3.3: Binary chunks of $u$ bits are padded to $q^e$ with $e=O(u)$, which costs a fixed factor in volume, and the padded entries are scanned away after the interchange.
  Source: "Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with" (paper)
  > Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with $q^e\ge2^u$. Pad each of the two chunk ranges numerically from $[2^u]$ to $[q^e]$, putting zero in an entry if either chunk coordinate is invalid. The increase in volume is less than $q^2$, a fixed factor. The padding is a nested scan through consecutive valid and invalid intervals, with their lengths prepared from the shape. It costs $O(V)$ with a constant depending on $q$. Lexicographic radix-$q$ order of $[q^e]$ is its numerical order, just as binary order of $[2^u]$ is its numerical order. Padding therefore preserves the order of the existing entries without converting the digits of every address. The completed interchange preserves the set on which both chunk coordinates lie below $2^u$. Scan away the other entries to recover the desired binary array. Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is $O(Vu^\tau)$. \end{proof}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S2.1 (on [Matrix shear on address fields](matrix-shear.md)): For a rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$, the address permutation $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ modulo $q^b$ costs exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ further work.
- S2.2 (on [Recursive power saving from the rank deficit](recursive-power-saving.md)): For $e=m^k$ digits and a row field divisible by $W^k$, interchanging two chunks of $e$ digits costs $O(V e^\tau)$, because the shear $H\leftarrow H+D$ is made of $s$ calls on $e/m$ digits, each on a role stream of volume $V/W$, and $s/W<m^\tau$ with $\tau<1$.

- "Power-width interchange with rows" (paper)

  > \begin{proposition}[Power-width interchange with rows] \label{prop:power-interchange} Assume the fixed circuit data satisfy \eqref{eq:finite-shear-contract}, and let $q$ be a prime as in Lemma~\ref{lem:matrix-shear} for its edge matrices, also avoiding the denominators of every assigned terminal and gate matrix $M$. Choose a rational number $\tau\in(0,1)$ with $s/W<m^\tau$. For every $e=m^k$, $k\ge0$, consider two disjoint contiguous address chunks of $e$ radix-$q$ digits each. Suppose a row field preceding both chunks has length divisible by $W^k$. There may be additional fields before and after the row field, between the chunks, and after them. The chunks can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time, preserving every other address field, on a fixed number of finite-alphabet tapes. The constant is independent of all field lengths and of the data. \end{proposition}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-fast-chunk-interchange.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-fast-chunk-interchange.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0016-write-fast-chunk-interchange` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0016-write-fast-chunk-interchange`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
