# exegenius task 0047-audit-fast-address-interchange

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has finished an undergraduate computer science degree: asymptotic analysis, discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes, binary representation, induction), introductory linear algebra (vectors, matrices, inverses, dot products), and the calculus the degree requires (limits, convergence of sequences and series, basic integrals). They know basic Turing machines with several tapes and standard algorithm analysis, including recurrences and schoolbook multiplication.

# Fast interchange of address fields

Fast interchange of address fields is a fixed-tape procedure that swaps two disjoint contiguous address fields of an array, and it speeds up the address moves of the multiplication construction. The procedure acts on fields of an array laid out as in [Address fields and array layout on tapes](address-fields.md). Each field has $u$ bits, so $u$ counts the bits in each field. Here $V$ is the stored bit volume, the number of bits stored in the array, and $\tau$ is a fixed exponent below 1. The cost is $O(Vu^\tau)$ (cited).

Write $H$ and $D$ for the two fields, each viewed as a vector of entries over a common residue ring. Swapping them takes three updates:

$$D\leftarrow D-H,\qquad H\leftarrow H+D,\qquad D\leftarrow H-D.$$

Starting from $(H,D)$, the first update gives $(H,D-H)$, the second gives $(D,D-H)$, and the third gives $(D,H)$. The updates are linear combinations of entries, so the result holds for every choice of values.

The middle update is the one the network carries out. The procedure is built from the [Address shear and lower-triangular factorization](address-shear-factorization.md): the network's endpoint operator is the shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+D,D)$ over a residue ring, which is exactly $H\leftarrow H+D$, with its rank reduced by a lower-triangular factorization.

Two further linear-cost address updates complete the interchange. They are the outer two updates, which change only $D$ and take time linear in the stored volume, so the network supplies the only expensive step.

The network's cost bound follows from [Recursive power saving from s<Wm](recursive-power-saving.md), since the middle shear is computed by recursive calls on smaller streams of the array.

The final effect is an exact permutation, although the network uses only pointwise XOR gates, so its intermediate values are XOR combinations of data. The shear is applied to every row, including rows used as scratch with arbitrary initial contents. Exactness is secured by the [Restoring auxiliary scratch values](scratch-restoration.md) schedule, which subtracts the initial register value, computes, adds the result back, and reverses. (cited).
