# exegenius task 0069-write-fast-butterfly-layers

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Fast simultaneous butterfly layers
Gloss: Applies H0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2) on selected address bits of polynomial-valued arrays with exact Gaussian dyadics in O(V d^λ') with λ'<1, one truncation at the end.

## This page in the argument

The step: A simultaneous layer of $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ on selected address bits of polynomial-valued arrays costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$, with a single truncation at the end.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- An $n$-bit integer product is computed by a fixed-tape machine in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time, $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce multiplication to ring convolution and speed up its address moves and butterfly layers (on [Integer multiplication in O(n(lg n)^{1-κ}) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two fixed-tape procedures, an address interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for fixed exponents below 1, where $V$ is the stored bit volume.; how: build both procedures from one finite linear network and a recursion that saves a power

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The second procedure applies" (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "The smaller products are applied to disjoint halves of the rows, and the moves are then undone." (The page does not say how C^{\otimes D} splits into smaller products, what the halves of the rows are, or what the moves are; the reader cannot check that the recursion works.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "since each recursive call uses fewer calls on less volume" (The page asserts the exponent lambda' < 1 follows from the recursion but gives no recurrence or count of calls and volumes, so the reader cannot check the exponent.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$." (The cost bound is stated without derivation; it depends on the unexplained recursion and exponent above.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The phases act on each coefficient with work linear in its width" (The page never defines the width of a coefficient, so the reader cannot check the phase cost or the conclusion that the cost lies in computing C^{\otimes D}.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "the coefficients stay in the unit disk, so every intermediate value is an exact Gaussian dyadic" (No argument is given that the intermediate coefficients stay in the unit disk; the factors C and S alone do not obviously preserve it, and the reader cannot check it from the page.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "is an exact Gaussian dyadic. (cited). (cited)" (Two claims are marked (cited) but the page does not say what they state or where they are used, so their content and role are unknown to the reader.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The layer's single truncation is bounded as in" (The page never says where the layer truncates or what is truncated, so the reader cannot tell what the linked bound applies to.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- Say what $u$ denotes where it is first used (for a size or count, what it counts): "$H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$" (The page gives the butterfly formula in u and v but never says what u and v denote (the two inputs, the two records, or something else).)
- Say what $v$ denotes where it is first used (for a size or count, what it counts): "$H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$" (The page gives the butterfly formula in u and v but never says what u and v denote (the two inputs, the two records, or something else).)
- Say what $\otimes$ denotes where it is first used (for a size or count, what it counts): "The tensor product $C^{\otimes D}$ is computed recursively." (The page names the tensor product and uses \otimes but never says what it denotes for matrices; the reader is not told it is the Kronecker product.)
- Explain "tensor product of matrices" in a sentence where it is first used.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 339 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 423 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

Fast simultaneous butterfly layers is a fixed-tape procedure that applies the butterfly $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ to one bit position in several address chunks at once. The multiplication algorithm needs it because applying the butterflies one at a time would cost one whole-array pass for each.

## The layer

Let $D$ be the number of selected address chunks. Let $d$ be an upper bound on $D$, so $D\le d$. Let $K$ be the number of bits in each chunk. Let $V$ be the number of stored bits. Let $\lambda'<1$ be a fixed exponent. The address set is the unselected bits together with the $D$ chunks, in lexicographic order. Each address holds a polynomial record with $r$ coefficients, and $H_0$ combines pairs of records coefficientwise, leaving every other address bit unchanged. The cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$.

## Method

Let $X$ be the bit-flip matrix. Let $\mathsf S$ be the diagonal phase matrix $\operatorname{diag}(1,i)$. Let $C=\tfrac12\bigl((1+i)I+(1-i)X\bigr)$ be the two-point kernel. Then $H_0=\tfrac{1-i}{2}\,\mathsf S C\mathsf S$ and $C^2=X$. So each butterfly is the kernel $C$ between two diagonal phases, and $D$ selected bits give $H_0^{\otimes D}$ equal to a scalar times $\mathsf S^{\otimes D}C^{\otimes D}\mathsf S^{\otimes D}$. The phases act on each coefficient with work linear in its width, so the cost lies in computing $C^{\otimes D}$.

The tensor product $C^{\otimes D}$ is computed recursively. The layer moves whole chunks by [Fast interchange of address fields](fast-address-interchange.md) to bring each group of selected bits to a common offset. The smaller products are applied to disjoint halves of the rows, and the moves are then undone. The layer gets its exponent $\lambda'<1$ from [Recursive power saving from s<Wm](recursive-power-saving.md), since each recursive call uses fewer calls on less volume. The layer is built from the root multiplications of [Synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md), which are signed shifts.

For $D=2$ and records $f_{00},f_{01},f_{10},f_{11}$ indexed by the two selected bits, the output at index $00$ is $(f_{00}+f_{01}+f_{10}+f_{11})/4$.

## Exactness

A Gaussian dyadic is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. Each factor $H_0$ adds at most one binary digit to the denominators, and the coefficients stay in the unit disk, so every intermediate value is an exact Gaussian dyadic. <cite data-source="paper">Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics</cite>. <cite data-source="paper">The procedure evaluates the entire layer exactly before this final truncation.</cite> The layer's single truncation is bounded as in [Fixed-point precision and exact recovery](fixed-point-precision.md).

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0069-write-fast-butterfly-layers.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0069-write-fast-butterfly-layers.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0069-write-fast-butterfly-layers` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.
