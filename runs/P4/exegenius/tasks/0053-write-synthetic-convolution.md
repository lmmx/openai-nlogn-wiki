# exegenius task 0053-write-synthetic-convolution

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Convolution from the retained transform layout
Gloss: Normalized convolution over the polynomial ring: two forward synthetic transforms keep their layout, records are multiplied pointwise by signed packing, and the opposite transform consumes the same order; error below √2·M(3ℓ+1)2^{−p}.

## This page in the argument

The step: Normalized convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$ over $\mathcal R_r$ on disk-grid arrays is approximated with error below $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ in time $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$.
How: Apply the forward synthetic transform to both operands and keep their layout, multiply the corresponding length-$r$ records pointwise by signed packing, and apply the opposite transform, which consumes the same stored order.
Why: Pointwise multiplication commutes with the same record permutation applied to both operands, so the product can be formed in the retained order and handed directly to the opposite procedure. (the sources say so: "forward outputs in their retained order and pass that order directly" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The normalized transforms $F_t^\pm$ over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ with synthetic roots $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$ are computed by radix-two butterflies plus monomial twiddles, and $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$ even though the ring has zero divisors. (on [Synthetic polynomial transform](synthetic-transform.md))
- The recursion writes frequency $j$ in slot $\mathrm{rev}(j)$, the bit reversal of $j$; the forward procedure $B_tF_t^-$ keeps this order and the opposite procedure $F_t^+B_t^{-1}$ consumes it directly, so no sort is needed between the pointwise product and the inverse transform. (on [Retained stored frequency order](frequency-order.md))
- A positional permutation $L$ moves chosen bit slots to a prefix and groups the remaining bits into $K$-bit chunks so that each transform round is a simultaneous butterfly layer; each transform costs $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$ with error below $\sqrt2\,\ell\,2^{-p}$. (on [Transform layout and cost](transform-layout.md))
- Two disk-grid polynomials in $\mathcal R_r$ are multiplied exactly by evaluating their coefficients at $B_0=2^{4p}$ as signed integers, multiplying with the established integer multiplier, extracting centered coefficients, wrapping negacyclically and truncating, in $O(rp\log(rp))$ time. (on [Signed Kronecker packing for ring products](signed-packing.md))
- Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order, multiply the records by signed packing, apply the opposite procedure and scale exactly by $M=T/r$.
- The two forward errors, the product truncation and the opposite transform total less than $3\delta+\eta$ before the scaling by $M$, giving the stated error.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce multiplication to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ through radix digits, Chinese-remainder axes, Gaussian resampling and chirps, speed up the data movement and the butterfly arithmetic with two network-based tape procedures with a strict rank saving, recover the exact product by rounding and carries, and add up the costs.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (H5, H6). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**H5**: Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order, multiply the records by signed packing, apply the opposite procedure and scale exactly by $M=T/r$.
Source: "Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order." (paper)
> \begin{proposition}[Convolution from the retained transform layout] \label{prop:synthetic-convolution} Under the hypotheses of Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost}, $\mathcal M_r$ on disk grid operands has an approximation with error less than \begin{equation} \sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p} \label{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} \end{equation} and cost \[ O\left(Tp\left[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'} +\log(rp)\right]\right). \] Put $m_M=\log_2M$ and $w_M=w+m_M$. The returned grid array is in the original array and coefficient order, with the same two's-complement component format at width $w_M$. The procedure supplies $\Gamma(w_M)$ on the output descriptor tape, so the caller knows every component boundary from this width and the retained shape parameters. If one operand has norm at most $\rho<1$ and the bound in \eqref{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} is at most $1-\rho$, the returned grid array is a disk array. \end{proposition} \begin{proof} Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order. Pass the supplied $p,r,w$ to Lemma~\ref{lem:signed-ring-product} for corresponding polynomial records. Its output keeps that record order and uses the component format required by the opposite procedure. Apply the opposite procedure to that order, and multiply its result exactly by $M=T/r$.

**H6**: The two forward errors, the product truncation and the opposite transform total less than $3\delta+\eta$ before the scaling by $M$, giving the stated error.
Source: "For the error estimate, put" (paper)
> For the error estimate, put $\delta=\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}$ and $\eta=\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$. Let $u,v$ be the exact stored forward outputs and $\widetilde u,\widetilde v$ the returned ones. All four are disk arrays, and each forward error is less than $\delta$. The exact map $P$ is bilinear and satisfies $\|P(x,y)\|_\infty\leq\|x\|_\infty\|y\|_\infty$ by the coefficient bound in Lemma~\ref{lem:signed-ring-product}. Hence \[ \begin{split} P(\widetilde u,\widetilde v)-P(u,v) &=P(\widetilde u-u,\widetilde v)+P(u,\widetilde v-v),\\ \|P(\widetilde u,\widetilde v)-P(u,v)\|_\infty &<2\delta, \end{split} \] where the first term uses the disk bound on $\widetilde v$ and the second uses it on $u$. Write $\widetilde z=Q_p(P(\widetilde u,\widetilde v))$ and $z_*=P(u,v)$. The product lemma makes $\widetilde z$ a disk grid array and gives $\|\widetilde z-z_*\|_\infty<2\delta+\eta$. If $\widetilde h$ is the returned opposite output, its approximation bound applies to $\widetilde z$. Since $\mathcal T_+$ is a contraction, \[ \|\widetilde h-\mathcal T_+ z_*\|_\infty \leq\|\widetilde h-\mathcal T_+\widetilde z\|_\infty +\|\mathcal T_+(\widetilde z-z_*)\|_\infty <3\delta+\eta. \] The final exact multiplication by $M$ therefore gives error less than $M(3\delta+\eta)=\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$, as claimed. If one original operand has norm at most $\rho$, then $\|\mathcal M_r(f,g)\|_\infty\leq\rho$. Under the stated error margin, the returned norm is less than $\rho+(1-\rho)=1$.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0053-write-synthetic-convolution.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0053-write-synthetic-convolution.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0053-write-synthetic-convolution` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0053-write-synthetic-convolution`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
