Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F2V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Chunk interchange in O(Vu^τ) time
Gloss: Interchanges two disjoint address chunks of u bits in any bit array in O(V u^τ) steps for a fixed τ < 1, by padding rows and splitting the width in base m into power-width pieces; intermediate steps are XOR combinations but the final effect is an exact permutation.
Heading: Chunk interchange in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $V$ (stored bit volume): the number of data bits stored in the array.
- $u$ (chunk width): the number of bits in each of the two interchanged address chunks.
- $\tau$ (interchange exponent): a fixed rational constant strictly below 1, namely 1 - 2^{-50}.

## This page in the argument

The step: Two disjoint address chunks of $u$ bits in any bit array of volume $V$ are interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ steps for a fixed $\tau<1$.
How: obtain the interchange from three shears whose middle one runs through the rank-saving bit network recursively on power widths, then lift to arbitrary widths
Why: A swap of two chunks is three shears; the shear is exactly what the network with total rank $s<Wm$ computes cheaply by recursion on smaller chunks. (the sources say so: "$m$, the resulting recurrence saves a power of the chunk width." (paper))
Striking feature: Although the final effect is an exact permutation, the intermediate steps form XOR combinations of data, which is why the rank saving is available. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Every rational square matrix of rank $a$ factors as $E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ a partial permutation matrix with exactly $a$ ones. (on [Lower-triangular rank factorization](triangular-factorization.md))
- The address update $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ costs exactly $\operatorname{rank}(A)$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ further work. (on [Cost of a rational matrix shear](matrix-shear.md))
- Two chunks of $e=m^k$ radix-$q$ digits (with enough rows) are interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time. (on [Power-width chunk interchange in O(Ve^τ) time](power-width-interchange.md))
- Any two equal-width bit chunks, in any array, can be interchanged with no row restriction in $O(Vu^\tau)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: start from the Gaussian-resampling reduction of multiplication to transforms, make the transforms cheaper by two tape procedures that each save a power of the logarithm, then recover the product exactly and add up all costs (on [Multiplying n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures cost a power of the width less than one per unit volume: interchange of two $u$-bit address chunks in $O(Vu^\tau)$ and a simultaneous butterfly layer on $d$ chunks in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$.; how: build the elementary scans and one fixed linear exchange network whose edges have total rank $s<Wm$, and derive from it two recursions in which each level multiplies the cost per volume by $s/W<m$

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.4.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.4.4**: Any two equal-width bit chunks, in any array, can be interchanged with no row restriction in $O(Vu^\tau)$.
How: move the top $\rho=O(\log e)$ digits of each chunk into a row field long enough for the splitting, pad the rows, and cut the remaining width into power-width pieces by its base-$m$ expansion
- S1.4.4.1: Write each chunk as its top $\rho$ digits followed by the rest, exchange the high digits, and join them into a row field of range $R\ge W^k$.
  Source: "Write each chunk as its top $\rho$ digits followed by its remaining" (paper)
  > Write each chunk as its top $\rho$ digits followed by its remaining digits, denoted $h^+,h^-$ and $d^+,d^-$, respectively. Interchange the corresponding high digits one pair at a time. The high positions now contain $d^+$ and $h^+$; move the digits of the latter, preserving their order, into consecutive positions immediately after $d^+$. Suppressing the prefix and suffix, the field orders during the construction are \[ \begin{aligned} &(h^+,h^-,g,d^+,d^-),\\ &(d^+,h^+,h^-,g,d^-) &&\text{after exchanging and joining the high parts},\\ &(d^+,h^+,d^-,g,h^-) &&\text{after interchanging the remaining parts},\\ &(d^+,d^-,g,h^+,h^-) &&\text{after separating the high parts again}. \end{aligned} \] In the two middle orders, the first two fields form a row field of range \[ R=q^{2\rho}\ge W^k \] before both remaining chunks. The joining moves preserve the order of the remaining digits and the gap field. Exchanging and joining the high parts costs $O(V\rho)$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:elementary-streams}. Append zero rows, separately within each preceding prefix, until the row count is \[ R'=W^k\left\lceil R/W^k\right\rceil<2R. \] This changes the row field's length; it need not remain a power of $q$ during the computation. The padded logical volume is less than $2V$.
- S1.4.4.2: Append zero rows until the row count is a multiple of $W^k$, at most doubling the volume.
  Source: "Append zero rows, separately within" (paper)
  > Write each chunk as its top $\rho$ digits followed by its remaining digits, denoted $h^+,h^-$ and $d^+,d^-$, respectively. Interchange the corresponding high digits one pair at a time. The high positions now contain $d^+$ and $h^+$; move the digits of the latter, preserving their order, into consecutive positions immediately after $d^+$. Suppressing the prefix and suffix, the field orders during the construction are \[ \begin{aligned} &(h^+,h^-,g,d^+,d^-),\\ &(d^+,h^+,h^-,g,d^-) &&\text{after exchanging and joining the high parts},\\ &(d^+,h^+,d^-,g,h^-) &&\text{after interchanging the remaining parts},\\ &(d^+,d^-,g,h^+,h^-) &&\text{after separating the high parts again}. \end{aligned} \] In the two middle orders, the first two fields form a row field of range \[ R=q^{2\rho}\ge W^k \] before both remaining chunks.

The padded logical volume is less than $2V$.
- S1.4.4.3: Write the remaining width $e-\rho$ in base $m$ and interchange corresponding pieces with the power-width procedure.
  Source: "Write the remaining width in base $m$:" (paper)
  > Write the remaining width in base $m$: \[ e-\rho=\sum_{j=0}^{k} a_jm^j,\qquad 0\le a_j<m. \] Partition each remaining chunk into corresponding consecutive pieces, with $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$. Apply Proposition~\ref{prop:power-interchange} to each corresponding pair. All these calls use the same row field of length $R'$, which is divisible by each required $W^j$. At completion every call preserves its row address, so it neither mixes genuine rows with padded rows nor depends on the values used for padding. The padded zero rows remain zero at these completed-call boundaries. The sum of the costs is bounded by \[ O(V)\sum_j a_jm^{j\tau}=O(Ve^\tau). \] The fixed bound $a_j<m$ and the inequality $m^k<me$ make this a geometric sum of the stated order. Scan away the padded rows, then reverse only the moves that joined the high parts. This is the last transition in the field-order display: $h^+$ returns to the later high position, while $d^+$ stays in the earlier one. The final order is therefore the required interchange of the two full chunks. The remaining movement cost $O(V\log(2e))$ is $O(Ve^\tau)$. Computing the piece list and every new shape is polynomial in $\log(2V)$ per piece. There are at most $(m-1)(k+1)=O(\log(2e))$ pieces; since $V\ge q^{2e}$, their total descriptor cost is a fixed power of $\log(2V)$ and hence $O(V)$. Each power-width call uses the fixed schedule proved above and leaves its work tapes clean.
- S1.4.4.4: The costs sum to $O(V)\sum_j a_jm^{j\tau}=O(Ve^\tau)$.
  Source: "O(V)\sum_j a_jm^{j\tau}=O(Ve^\tau)." (paper)
  > Write the remaining width in base $m$: \[ e-\rho=\sum_{j=0}^{k} a_jm^j,\qquad 0\le a_j<m. \] Partition each remaining chunk into corresponding consecutive pieces, with $a_j$ pieces of width $m^j$. Apply Proposition~\ref{prop:power-interchange} to each corresponding pair. All these calls use the same row field of length $R'$, which is divisible by each required $W^j$. At completion every call preserves its row address, so it neither mixes genuine rows with padded rows nor depends on the values used for padding. The padded zero rows remain zero at these completed-call boundaries. The sum of the costs is bounded by \[ O(V)\sum_j a_jm^{j\tau}=O(Ve^\tau). \] The fixed bound $a_j<m$ and the inequality $m^k<me$ make this a geometric sum of the stated order. Scan away the padded rows, then reverse only the moves that joined the high parts. This is the last transition in the field-order display: $h^+$ returns to the later high position, while $d^+$ stays in the earlier one. The final order is therefore the required interchange of the two full chunks. The remaining movement cost $O(V\log(2e))$ is $O(Ve^\tau)$. Computing the piece list and every new shape is polynomial in $\log(2V)$ per piece. There are at most $(m-1)(k+1)=O(\log(2e))$ pieces; since $V\ge q^{2e}$, their total descriptor cost is a fixed power of $\log(2V)$ and hence $O(V)$. Each power-width call uses the fixed schedule proved above and leaves its work tapes clean.
- S1.4.4.5: Binary chunks are padded to the next width $q^e\ge 2^u$, at a fixed-factor volume cost, and the padding is scanned away.
  Source: "Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with" (paper)
  > Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with $q^e\ge2^u$. Pad each of the two chunk ranges numerically from $[2^u]$ to $[q^e]$, putting zero in an entry if either chunk coordinate is invalid. The increase in volume is less than $q^2$, a fixed factor. The padding is a nested scan through consecutive valid and invalid intervals, with their lengths prepared from the shape. It costs $O(V)$ with a constant depending on $q$. Lexicographic radix-$q$ order of $[q^e]$ is its numerical order, just as binary order of $[2^u]$ is its numerical order. Padding therefore preserves the order of the existing entries without converting the digits of every address. The completed interchange preserves the set on which both chunk coordinates lie below $2^u$. Scan away the other entries to recover the desired binary array. Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is $O(Vu^\tau)$. \end{proof}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S1.4.1 (on [Lower-triangular rank factorization](triangular-factorization.md)): Every rational square matrix of rank $a$ factors as $E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ a partial permutation matrix with exactly $a$ ones.
- S1.4.2 (on [Cost of a rational matrix shear](matrix-shear.md)): The address update $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ costs exactly $\operatorname{rank}(A)$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ further work.
- S1.4.3 (on [Power-width chunk interchange in O(Ve^τ) time](power-width-interchange.md)): Two chunks of $e=m^k$ radix-$q$ digits (with enough rows) are interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Power-width chunk interchange in O(Ve^τ) time](power-width-interchange.md): Recursively interchanges two chunks of e = m^k digits by running the bank-exchange network on W role streams of volume V/W, each edge costing rank-many smaller interchanges; since s/W < m^τ the cost per volume is O(e^τ).
  Shown as: Chunk interchange in O(Vu^τ) time *<predicate>* Power-width chunk interchange in O(Ve^τ) time

## Pages that build on this one

- Packed XOR of selected bits across address chunks: A binary row addition y ← y ⊕ x on the selected bit of each of f chunks at once, done by a constant number of cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges followed by deterministic repair of a small explicit set of bad addresses, using a third chunk as restored temporary space.
- Layout and cost of the synthetic transform: A positional layout permutation puts the selected bits of all axes at a common offset in K-bit chunks so each transform round is one simultaneous layer; the forward transform keeps its output order for the pointwise product and the opposite transform.
- Cost accounting and the saving exponent κ: A table of costs divided by Tp, each at most p^{1−2κ} thanks to the slack in the chosen exponents (seven dominant margins, the smallest 2^{-181} = 2κ), giving O(n (log n)^{1−κ}) overall.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "in $O(Vu^\tau)$ steps, where $V=PG B\,2^{2u}$" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Arbitrary-width interchange] \label{lem:chunk-swap} There exist fixed $0<\tau<1$ and one fixed finite-alphabet multitape procedure with the following property. For positive integers $P,G,B$ and $u\ge1$, it transforms an arbitrary bit array on \[ [P]\times[2^u]\times[G]\times[2^u]\times[B] \] by the address permutation \[ (p,h,g,d,z)\longmapsto(p,d,g,h,z) \] in $O(Vu^\tau)$ steps, where $V=PG B\,2^{2u}$. The integers specifying the shape are part of the input. The time includes their processing, all padding and unpadding, and fixed-tape workspace cleanup. In particular, $B=1$ is allowed. \end{lemma}

  > The first procedure interchanges two disjoint contiguous address fields of $u$ bits in an array whose addresses form a complete Cartesian product. Its cost is $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$. Although its final effect is an exact permutation, its intermediate steps form pointwise XOR combinations of data. The final permutation is exact for arbitrary initial auxiliary values.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-chunk-swap.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-chunk-swap.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0018-write-chunk-swap` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0018-write-chunk-swap`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
