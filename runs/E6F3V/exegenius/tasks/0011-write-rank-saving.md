Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F3V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Strict rank saving
Gloss: The total rank s of all edge changes in the fixed network is strictly less than W·m (wires times label dimension), which makes each recursive level cost a factor s/W < m.

## This page in the argument

The step: In the bit network the total rank $s$ of all edge changes $M_{\mathrm{head}(e)}-M_{\mathrm{tail}(e)}$ is strictly less than $Wm$, the endpoint matrices differ by the identity on every role, and consequently $s/W<m^\tau$ for $\tau=1-2^{-50}$.
How: Take each edge matrix to be a difference of orthogonal projections onto the nested labels, so its rank is the dimension change; add up dimension changes over the network (plus one extra rank per source) and compare with $Wm$.
Why: The saving comes from the small total dimension lost on decreasing edges. (the sources say so: "The saving will come from keeping the total dimension lost on decreasing
edges small relative to $N$." (paper))
Striking feature: The total rank is below $Wm$ by a margin of only about $10^{-14}$ in relative terms, yet any strict deficit suffices to give a power saving $m^	au$ with $	au<1$; the deficit comes from the few decreasing edges and the unit-rank sources. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Attaching nested nondegenerate subspaces of the $m$-dimensional space $F^{\otimes 3}$ to gates and terminals makes each edge's orthogonal residual have dimension equal to the number of smaller operations the edge needs; only the central-wire edges from time 3 to time 4 decrease, with total loss $L<N/2$. (on [Nested subspace labels and orthogonal residuals](subspace-labels.md))
- For nested nondegenerate labels $U\subset V$, the matrix $P_V-P_U$ has rank $\dim V-\dim U$, so an edge's rank equals its dimension change.
- Apart from the $N$ negative source projections, edge ranks equal dimension changes, so the rank sum is $s=Wm-N+2L$ with deficit $N-2L>0$ below $Wm$.
- For an input $X_a$ the endpoint difference is $P_{U_a^\perp}-(-P_{U_a})=I_m$; every other role has source matrix $0$ and sink matrix $I_m$.
- The relative deficit exceeds $20\cdot2^{-50}$, so $m^{1-2^{-50}}>m(1-\eta)$ and hence $s/W<m^\tau$ with $\tau=1-2^{-50}$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution of short digits evaluated by Fourier transforms, speed up the two costly ingredients (moving data between addresses, and butterfly arithmetic) by a power of a block size using one recursive saving, and total every cost term. (on [Sub-n-log-n integer multiplication](main-theorem.md))
- Two disjoint equal-width bit chunks of $u$ bits in an address array of volume $V$ can be interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ steps for a fixed $\tau<1$, by XOR combinations whose final effect is an exact permutation.; how: First interchange chunks whose width is a power of $m$ and which have enough rows (the key construction), then remove those restrictions by taking rows from a few high digits of the chunks, cutting the remaining width into base-$m$ pieces, and padding binary chunks to the working radix. (on [Address chunk interchange](chunk-interchange.md))
- Two address chunks of $e=m^k$ radix-$q$ digits can be interchanged in $O(Ve^\tau)$ time by running the bit network on $W$ cyclic role streams, with one smaller interchange per unit of edge rank.; how: Run the exchange network on arrays: give each vertex an address-shear frame, split the rows among the $W$ roles so every gate acts pointwise, make each edge cost one smaller interchange per unit of its rank, and solve the resulting recurrence. (on [Power-width chunk interchange](power-width-interchange.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (K.3.2, K.3.3, K.3.4, K.3.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**K.3.2**: For nested nondegenerate labels $U\subset V$, the matrix $P_V-P_U$ has rank $\dim V-\dim U$, so an edge's rank equals its dimension change.
Source: "For $U\subset V$ nondegenerate,
$P_V-P_U$ is the identity on $V\cap U^\perp$ and zero on its
orthogonal complement.  Its rank is $\dim V-\dim U$; reversing the
edge negates the matrix without changing its rank." (paper)
> \begin{proof} Lemma~\ref{lem:scalar-motifs} gives the scalar permutation, including all auxiliary roles. For $U\subset V$ nondegenerate, $P_V-P_U$ is the identity on $V\cap U^\perp$ and zero on its orthogonal complement. Its rank is $\dim V-\dim U$; reversing the edge negates the matrix without changing its rank. The only exceptions are the $N$ negative source projections. At stage 1, $B=0$, and the first gate on $X_a$ has label exactly $U_a$. Its first edge matrix is therefore $2P_{U_a}$, of rational rank one, where the corresponding dimension change was zero. Lemma~\ref{lem:motif-residuals} consequently gives the stated rank sum. Its deficit from $W_{\rm b}m$ is $N-2L_{\rm b}>0$.

**K.3.3**: Apart from the $N$ negative source projections, edge ranks equal dimension changes, so the rank sum is $s=Wm-N+2L$ with deficit $N-2L>0$ below $Wm$.
Source: "Lemma~\ref{lem:motif-residuals} consequently gives the stated rank sum.
Its deficit from $W_{\rm b}m$ is $N-2L_{\rm b}>0$." (paper)
> \begin{proof} Lemma~\ref{lem:scalar-motifs} gives the scalar permutation, including all auxiliary roles.

Lemma~\ref{lem:motif-residuals} consequently gives the stated rank sum. Its deficit from $W_{\rm b}m$ is $N-2L_{\rm b}>0$.

**K.3.4**: For an input $X_a$ the endpoint difference is $P_{U_a^\perp}-(-P_{U_a})=I_m$; every other role has source matrix $0$ and sink matrix $I_m$.
Source: "For an input $X_a$ the endpoint difference is
$P_{U_a^\perp}-(-P_{U_a})=I_m$.  Every other role has zero source
matrix and identity sink matrix.  This proves the interface." (paper)
> For an input $X_a$ the endpoint difference is $P_{U_a^\perp}-(-P_{U_a})=I_m$. Every other role has zero source matrix and identity sink matrix. This proves the interface. \end{proof}

**K.3.5**: The relative deficit exceeds $20\cdot2^{-50}$, so $m^{1-2^{-50}}>m(1-\eta)$ and hence $s/W<m^\tau$ with $\tau=1-2^{-50}$.
Source: "Consequently
\[
 \frac{s_{\rm b}}{W_{\rm b}}<m^\tau,
 \qquad \frac{s_{\rm c}}{W_{\rm c}}<m^\sigma,
 \qquad 0<\tau=\sigma<1." (paper)
> The relative rank deficits are \[ \eta_{\rm b}=\frac{W_{\rm b}m-s_{\rm b}}{W_{\rm b}m} =\frac{339}{22587335000000},\qquad \eta_{\rm c}=\frac{W_{\rm c}m-s_{\rm c}}{W_{\rm c}m} =\frac{73}{19906842167500}. \] For both recurrences we may use the fixed rational exponent \begin{equation} \tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50}. \label{eq:explicit-motif-exponents} \end{equation} Both exact deficits displayed above are greater than $20\cdot2^{-50}$. Since $m<2^{20}$ and $\log 2<1$, we have $\log m<20$, whence \[ m^{1-2^{-50}} =m\exp(-2^{-50}\log m) >m(1-20\cdot2^{-50})>m(1-\eta) \] for either $\eta=\eta_{\rm b}$ or $\eta=\eta_{\rm c}$. Consequently \[ \frac{s_{\rm b}}{W_{\rm b}}<m^\tau, \qquad \frac{s_{\rm c}}{W_{\rm c}}<m^\sigma, \qquad 0<\tau=\sigma<1. \] Here $\sigma$ is a rational upper bound for the logarithmic exponent of the complex recurrence. \section{Faster interchange of address chunks} \label{sec:tape-interchange}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- K.3.1 (on [Nested subspace labels and orthogonal residuals](subspace-labels.md)): Attaching nested nondegenerate subspaces of the $m$-dimensional space $F^{\otimes 3}$ to gates and terminals makes each edge's orthogonal residual have dimension equal to the number of smaller operations the edge needs; only the central-wire edges from time 3 to time 4 decrease, with total loss $L<N/2$.

## Pages that build on this one

- Power-width chunk interchange: Interchanging two address chunks of m^k digits by running the bit network on W cyclic role streams, with one smaller interchange per unit of edge rank, giving the recurrence F_k ≤ (s/W)F_{k−1} + O(1) and cost O(V e^τ).
- Simultaneous butterfly layer: Applying H₀ to one selected bit in each of D address chunks at once, on arrays of ring records, in O(V d^{λ′}) with λ′ < 1 instead of D whole-array passes, via the recursive complex network on packed bit changes.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$." (paper)

  > The finite construction in Section~\ref{sec:finite-networks} attaches subspaces of a fixed $m$-dimensional space to its gates and terminals. The subspaces at adjacent vertices are nested. Their dimension changes count the smaller operations needed on an edge, with an additional source contribution in the bit construction. The construction uses three-element subsets: gather and scatter create coefficients depending on intersection size, and auxiliary wires cancel the unwanted coefficients. Orthogonality of the corresponding indicator vectors permits the subspace assignments. The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.

- "This strict inequality is the source of the power saving." (paper)

  > A recursive call at parameter $mf$ therefore uses $s$ calls at parameter $f$, each on a stream of volume $V/W$. The parameter counts field digits for address interchange and selected axes for a numerical layer. After dividing cost by volume, multiplying the parameter by $m$ increases the recursive contribution by $s/W<m$. This strict inequality is the source of the power saving. The later tape and arithmetic estimates preserve it, including the work of changing numerical address coordinates. Those changes are implemented by whole-chunk moves and controlled shifts, followed by a deterministic correction of the explicitly identified exceptional addresses.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0011-write-rank-saving.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0011-write-rank-saving.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0011-write-rank-saving` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0011-write-rank-saving`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
