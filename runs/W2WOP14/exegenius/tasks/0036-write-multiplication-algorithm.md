Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/W2WOP14` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: The multiplication algorithm
Gloss: The pipeline: form radix digits, apply the CRT address map Φ, run two source transforms (resampling plus chirp convolution plus resampling), multiply pointwise, run the opposite transform, rescale, round and propagate carries; inside the chirp convolution the last coordinate is twisted into C[y]/(y^r+1) and convolved with synthetic transforms.
Also called: reduction chain

## This page in the argument

The step: The multiplication algorithm: form base-$2^b$ digits, place them on distinct prime cyclic axes by the Chinese-remainder map $\Phi$, run two source transforms (Gaussian resampling plus chirp convolution through a twisted ring convolution), multiply pointwise, run the opposite transform, rescale, round and propagate carries, obtaining the exact $2n$-bit product in $O(Tp)$ steps beyond the layer costs.
How: Choose compatible parameters, reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of digit coefficients, evaluate the convolution through Gaussian-resampled transforms with all permutations left in the formulas, and recover exact integer coefficients from the approximations by an error bound below one half.
Why: A reader can follow how each reduction converts the problem into the shape the next tool handles: integer product, prime-axis convolution, power-of-two convolution, polynomial-ring convolution. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: A single reduction chain converts an integer product into a convolution on a product of prime-length axes, then into power-of-two axes with permutations never executed, then into a polynomial-ring convolution where the roots of unity are signed shifts. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Parameter choices: $b=\lceil\log_2n\rceil$, $p=6b$, $d=\lfloor b^\epsilon\rfloor$, $K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor$, a power of two $T\in[4n/b,8n/b)$, $r=2^{\lceil(\log_2T)/d\rceil}$, axis lengths $t_i\in\{r/2,r\}$ with $\prod t_i=T$, $t_d=r$, and distinct odd primes $s_i$ with $(1-2\eta)t_i<s_i\le(1-\eta)t_i$, $\eta=1/(4d)$, so that $T/2<S<T$ and every Gaussian-resampling hypothesis holds. (on [Parameter choices and prime source lengths](parameter-choice.md))
- Integer product as digit convolution: writing each input as $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ digits in base $2^b$, the product polynomial has degree at most $2q-2<2n/b\le T/2<S$ and coefficients $c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2<2^{3b}$, so cyclic convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no wraparound. (on [Integer product as digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md))
- Chinese-remainder address map: $\Phi:\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\to\mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_i^{s_i}-1)$, $x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$ with $P_i=\prod_{j<i}s_j$ and $\mu_i=P_i^{-1}\bmod s_i$, is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution, with $k=\sum_ja_jP_j$ mapped to axis coordinates $b_i=a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j\pmod{s_i}$, computed by triangular controlled shifts in $O(Tpd^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ time. (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-address-map.md))
- Coefficient twist: $\Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\to\mathcal R_r$, $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ with $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$, multiplies coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k$, and the negative wrap of $\mathcal R_r$ becomes the original cyclic wrap after untwisting; hence $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=(f*g)/T$. (on [Coefficient (phase) twist](phase-twist.md))
- Chirp and source-transform procedures: the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)))$ approximates $QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$, and the source transform $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ (resampling map $\mathcal A$, chirp transform, resampling map $\mathcal B_0$, scale $2^\gamma$) approximates $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$, with opposite-sign version by conjugation.
- The algorithm: form radix digits, apply $\Phi$, run two source transforms, multiply pointwise, run the opposite transform scaled by $S$, rescale by $2^{2b+4}S$, round to integers, undo $\Phi$ and propagate carries to the $2n$-bit product.
- Error propagation: each computed procedure is within a few multiples of $TL\,2^{-p}$ of its exact map ($L=\log_2T$): the ring convolution has error $<5TL$, the complex convolution $<6TL$, the chirp transform $<8TL$, and the source transform $<E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$ units of $2^{-p}$, with all intermediate arrays staying inside the unit disk.
- Exact recovery: rescaling the computed product by the known factors $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$ leaves coefficient error below $448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$, so rounding yields the exact integer coefficients $c_j<2^{3b}$, and radix-$2^b$ carries produce the $2n$-bit product. (on [Rounding and carry propagation](exact-recovery.md))

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution of short integer coefficients, evaluate the convolution through power-of-two transforms over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, and replace the two tape operations that each cost a factor $\log n$ (address rearrangement and butterfly layers) by procedures whose cost per bit is a power of their parameter below one; then total the costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S8.5, S8.6, S8.7). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S8.5**: Chirp and source-transform procedures: the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)))$ approximates $QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$, and the source transform $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ (resampling map $\mathcal A$, chirp transform, resampling map $\mathcal B_0$, scale $2^\gamma$) approximates $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$, with opposite-sign version by conjugation.
How: Compose the chirp convolution with the Gaussian maps on the zero-padded box, computing chirp phases modulo $2r$ with the established multiplier, and obtain the opposite transform by conjugating input and output.
- S8.5.1: The chirp phase numerator at tensor address $j$ is computed modulo $2r$ as $-\sum_is_ij_i^2(r/t_i)$ using the established multiplier, costing $O(Tdp^{1+\delta})$.
  Source: "-\sum_i s_i j_i^2(r/t_i)\pmod{2r}." (paper)
  > We next use the complex convolution to evaluate the middle factor $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$ in \eqref{eq:no-sort-tensor}, and then compose it with the Gaussian maps. For the chirp array $a$ in \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp}, the phase numerator at tensor address $j$ is computed modulo $2r$ as \[ -\sum_i s_i j_i^2(r/t_i)\pmod{2r}. \] All integers have $O(p)$ bits and $r/t_i\in\{1,2\}$. Scan the stored axis descriptors and compute the $d$ squares and products with the previously established integer multiplier. Additions, reductions modulo a power of two, and restarting local counters cost $O(p)$ per term; multiplication costs $O(p\log p)=O(p^{1+\delta})$. Exponential evaluation then has the same $O(p^{1+\delta})$ bound. Thus chirp construction costs $O(Td p^{1+\delta})$ in total. In particular, this cost includes the scan of the axis descriptors at every coefficient.
- S8.5.2: Chirp transform: $x_0=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)$, $y_0=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0)$, $\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot y_0)$, with $\widetilde a$ the kernel and $x_0$ the data operand.
  Source: "x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x),\\" (paper)
  > Let $\widetilde a$ be the resulting disk-grid array, so $\|\widetilde a-a\|_\infty<2\,2^{-p}$. For a disk-grid target tensor $x$ of norm at most $.6$, the computed chirp transform forms the arrays \[ \begin{aligned} x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x),\\ y_0&=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0),\\ \widetilde{\mathscr C}(x) &=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}y_0). \end{aligned} \] Thus $\widetilde a$ is the convolution kernel and $x_0$ is the data operand after the first endpoint phase. Replacing the approximations by exact phases and exact convolution gives $\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}\mathcal M_{\mathbb C} (a,\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}x)=QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$ by \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp}. Below we show that $\|x\|_\infty\le.6$ implies $\|x_0\|_\infty\le.6$, which supplies the smaller operand required by the computed convolution.
- S8.5.3: The source transform applies $\mathcal A$, then $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$, then $\mathcal B_0$, then multiplies numerators by $2^\gamma$; its exact counterpart is $\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A=RF_{\boldsymbol s}$.
  Source: "\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A" (paper)
  > For a source disk-grid tensor of norm at most $.5$, write $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ for the following procedure: apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal A$, apply the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$, apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal B_0$, and multiply the grid numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$. Its exact counterpart is \[ \mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A =RF_{\boldsymbol s}. \] Here an exact counterpart replaces every numerical subroutine by the exact map it approximates and omits truncations. The source arrays are stored in the padded power-of-two box, with zeros outside the valid source coordinates. The compressed scalar output uses $w_{\rm c}$-bit components. Appending $\gamma$ zero bits to each word gives the exact scaled numerator in the known signed width $w_{\rm c}+\gamma$. For the stated input norm, the disk estimate below proves that every scaled coordinate still belongs to $\mathbb D_p$. Its component numerators therefore have magnitude at most $2^p$, so a scan removes only leading sign-extension bits and returns the same integers in $w_{\rm c}$ bits. This scan costs $O(T(w_{\rm c}+\gamma))=O(Tp)$ and leaves the padded zero records zero. Define the opposite-sign procedure by \[ \widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z) =\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}; \] its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}.
- S8.5.4: The opposite-sign procedure is $\widetilde{\mathscr F}^+(z)=\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}$, with exact counterpart $RF^+_{\boldsymbol s}$.
  Source: "=\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)};" (paper)
  > For a source disk-grid tensor of norm at most $.5$, write $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ for the following procedure: apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal A$, apply the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$, apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal B_0$, and multiply the grid numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$. Its exact counterpart is \[ \mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A =RF_{\boldsymbol s}. \] Here an exact counterpart replaces every numerical subroutine by the exact map it approximates and omits truncations.

Define the opposite-sign procedure by \[ \widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z) =\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}; \] its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}.

**S8.6**: The algorithm: form radix digits, apply $\Phi$, run two source transforms, multiply pointwise, run the opposite transform scaled by $S$, rescale by $2^{2b+4}S$, round to integers, undo $\Phi$ and propagate carries to the $2n$-bit product.
How: Prepare scaled digits $a_j2^{-b-2}$ as exact grid values below $1/4$, apply the six listed steps, and use the two scales $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$ to undo the normalizations $(u*v)/S^2$ and the input scalings.
- S8.6.0: Read each operand backward in groups of $b$ bits to get digits $a_0,\dots,a_{q-1}$, write the exact grid numerator $a_j2^{p-b-2}$ (value $a_j2^{-b-2}$) as a real word with zero imaginary word, and append $S-q$ zero records.
  Source: "Read each stored operand backward from" (paper)
  > The source-transform procedures now supply the three transforms needed for the radix-digit convolution. Read each stored operand backward from its least significant end in groups of $b$ bits. This produces the radix-$2^b$ digits $a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}$ in increasing coefficient order. Buffer each group on a fixed work tape and read it back most significant bit first, reversing its least-significant-first input order; pad the final short group with leading zeroes. For digit $a_j$, write the exact grid numerator $a_j2^{p-b-2}$ in a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit real word, followed by a zero $w_{\rm c}$-bit imaginary word. This exponent is nonnegative because $p=6b$, and the represented value is exactly $a_j2^{-b-2}$. Append $S-q$ zero coefficient records. Buffering and ordering the groups costs $O(n)$, including the one partial group's padding, and writing the $S$ records costs $O(Sp)$. Together with the initial count and copies, this input conversion costs $O(n+Sp)=O(Tp)$; all $n$ input bits, including leading zeroes, are retained before the final group is padded.

- S8.6.7: The two occurrences of $S$ undo different normalizations: the exact counterpart after the three transforms is $(u*v)/S^2$, so after the first scale it is $w=(u*v)/S$, and the second scale gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$.
  Source: "The two occurrences of $S$ in this algorithm undo different" (paper)
  > The two occurrences of $S$ in this algorithm undo different normalizations. By \eqref{eq:source-permutation-cancel}, the exact counterpart after the three transforms is $(u*v)/S^2$, so after the first scale it is $w=(u*v)/S$. The second scale gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$, whose inverse image under $\Phi$ is the original integer coefficient convolution. The next subsection verifies the disk bounds needed by every call and proves that the final error is less than $1/2$; it also justifies the rounding, carries, and output length.

**S8.7**: Error propagation: each computed procedure is within a few multiples of $TL\,2^{-p}$ of its exact map ($L=\log_2T$): the ring convolution has error $<5TL$, the complex convolution $<6TL$, the chirp transform $<8TL$, and the source transform $<E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$ units of $2^{-p}$, with all intermediate arrays staying inside the unit disk.
How: Insert the exact bilinear or linear contraction at each computed input and add its error to the propagated input error (bilinear contraction bound $\|f'\|\|g'-g\|+\|g\|\|f'-f\|$), checking norms $.5\to.51\to.701\to.501$ to stay in the disk.
- S8.7.1: Ring convolution: three transform errors and the polynomial-product truncation total less than $3L+2$ before the scale $M$, so $E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL$ (units of $h_p=2^{-p}$), and the output has norm below $.7+5TLh_p<.701$.
  Source: "E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL." (paper)
  > For disk-grid ring arrays $f,g$, put $M=T/r$. Two normalized synthetic forwards, pointwise polynomial multiplication divided by $r$, and the normalized opposite transform give $(f*g)/(rM^2)$. The exact multiplication by $M$ in Proposition~\ref{prop:synthetic-convolution} then gives $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$. Before that multiplication, the three transform errors and the polynomial-product truncation total less than $3L+2$. Thus the error of the returned normalized convolution is bounded by \[ E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL. \] If one operand has norm at most $.7$, bilinear contraction gives $\|\mathcal M_r(f,g)\|\le.7$. Its computed grid output consequently has norm less than $.7+5TLh_p<.701$ for large $n$. This proves the disk margin after the scale $M$, without clipping the output.
- S8.7.2: Complex convolution with twists: inserting the exact $\mathcal M_r$ propagates two input twist errors (each below 4), the approximation contributes $E_{\rm ring}$ and the output untwist below 4, giving error below $6TLh_p$.
  Source: "<(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p." (paper)
  > To compare it with $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)$, insert the exact normalized $\mathcal M_r$ at $\iota f'$ and $\iota g'$. Its bilinear contraction bound propagates the two input twist errors, each less than $4$. Its approximation contributes $E_{\rm ring}$, and the output untwist contributes less than $4$. All these comparisons are at the normalized $\mathcal M_r$ interface, after its factor $M$. They give \[ \|\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(f,g) -\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)\| <(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p. \]
- S8.7.3: Chirp transform: kernel error 2, first phase 4, convolution $6TL$, last phase 4, so $\|\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)-QF_{\boldsymbol t}x\|<8TLh_p$.
  Source: "<(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p." (paper)
  > For its error, the exact operands $a$ and $\overline a\cdot x$ are in the disk because every entry of $a$ has modulus one. The kernel approximation contributes less than $2$ and the first endpoint multiplication contributes less than $4$ when inserted into the exact bilinear contraction $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}$. The computed convolution contributes less than $6TL$, and the last endpoint multiplication less than $4$. Equation~\eqref{eq:permuted-chirp} identifies the exact result, so \[ \|\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)-QF_{\boldsymbol t}x\| <(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p. \]
- S8.7.4: Source transform: expansion error $dp^2$, chirp $8TL$ and compression $dp^2$ give $2dp^2+8TL$ before the scale, so after the scale by $2^\gamma$ the error is below $E_sh_p$ with $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$ (using $2dp^2<TL$).
  Source: "E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL," (paper)
  > Finally let the input to a source transform have norm at most $.5$. The computed expansion has error less than $dp^2$ and norm less than $.5+dp^2h_p<.51$. It is therefore a permitted chirp input. The chirp output is in the disk by the preceding argument, so each compression call is defined and returns another disk-grid array. Insert the exact contractions $\mathcal A$, $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, and $\mathcal B_0$ at the computed inputs. The error before the source scale is less than $2dp^2+8TL$. Multiplication by $2^\gamma$ therefore gives error less than $2^\gamma(2dp^2+8TL)h_p$, which is bounded by $E_sh_p$ with \begin{equation}\label{eq:source-error} E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL, \end{equation} because $2dp^2<TL$ eventually. The exact source transform $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ is a contraction, so the scaled approximation has norm at most $.5+E_sh_p<.501$. Its exact numerator scaling therefore also leaves a disk-grid output without clipping. Conjugation preserves the grid and norm, so the opposite procedure has the same error and disk guarantee. All these margins may be enforced by one fixed cutoff. For example, $b\ge2^{24}$, together with the other eventual construction conditions, makes $dp^2h_p$, $8TLh_p$, $E_sh_p$ and $28\,2^\gamma T^2Lh_p$ smaller than $10^{-3}$.

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S8.1 (on [Parameter choices and prime source lengths](parameter-choice.md)): Parameter choices: $b=\lceil\log_2n\rceil$, $p=6b$, $d=\lfloor b^\epsilon\rfloor$, $K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor$, a power of two $T\in[4n/b,8n/b)$, $r=2^{\lceil(\log_2T)/d\rceil}$, axis lengths $t_i\in\{r/2,r\}$ with $\prod t_i=T$, $t_d=r$, and distinct odd primes $s_i$ with $(1-2\eta)t_i<s_i\le(1-\eta)t_i$, $\eta=1/(4d)$, so that $T/2<S<T$ and every Gaussian-resampling hypothesis holds.
- S8.2 (on [Integer product as digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md)): Integer product as digit convolution: writing each input as $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ digits in base $2^b$, the product polynomial has degree at most $2q-2<2n/b\le T/2<S$ and coefficients $c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2<2^{3b}$, so cyclic convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no wraparound.
- S8.3 (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-address-map.md)): Chinese-remainder address map: $\Phi:\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\to\mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_i^{s_i}-1)$, $x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$ with $P_i=\prod_{j<i}s_j$ and $\mu_i=P_i^{-1}\bmod s_i$, is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution, with $k=\sum_ja_jP_j$ mapped to axis coordinates $b_i=a_i+\mu_i\sum_{j<i}a_jP_j\pmod{s_i}$, computed by triangular controlled shifts in $O(Tpd^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ time.
- S8.4 (on [Coefficient (phase) twist](phase-twist.md)): Coefficient twist: $\Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\to\mathcal R_r$, $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ with $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$, multiplies coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k$, and the negative wrap of $\mathcal R_r$ becomes the original cyclic wrap after untwisting; hence $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=(f*g)/T$.
- S8.8 (on [Rounding and carry propagation](exact-recovery.md)): Exact recovery: rescaling the computed product by the known factors $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$ leaves coefficient error below $448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$, so rounding yields the exact integer coefficients $c_j<2^{3b}$, and radix-$2^b$ carries produce the $2n$-bit product.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Integer product as digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md): Writing each n-bit input as a polynomial in 2^b with ⌈n/b⌉ digits, the integer product is the polynomial product, whose coefficients are below 2^{3b}; with enough zero padding the cyclic convolution has no wraparound, and carries recover the bits.

- [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-address-map.md): The Agarwal–Cooley isomorphism Φ: C[x]/(x^S−1) → C[x₁..x_d]/(x_i^{s_i}−1), x ↦ ∏ x_i^{μ_i}, for pairwise coprime (prime) s_i with S = ∏ s_i, which turns one long cyclic convolution into one on distinct prime axes and is implemented by triangular controlled shifts.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Chinese-remainder address map
- [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md): The Harvey–van der Hoeven reduction that expresses a Fourier transform of length s (here a prime) through a power-of-two transform of length t>s via Gaussian-weighted contractions: P_s F_s = 2^{2α²} B₀ P_t F_t A, with the two coordinate permutations P_s,P_t left inside the identity.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Gaussian resampling
- [Retained permutations and their cancellation](permutation-cancellation.md): Instead of executing the source and target coordinate permutations of Gaussian resampling as sorts, they stay in the transform formula; the source permutation R cancels across the two forward transforms, the pointwise product and the opposite transform: RF⁺[(RFu)(RFv)] = (u*v)/S².
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Retained permutations and their cancellation
- [Bluestein chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md): Writing a (permuted) transform as a chirp-weighted cyclic convolution QF_t u = ā · (a * (ā · u))/T with a_j = exp(−πi Σ s_i j_i²/t_i), so a Fourier transform with its target permutation becomes a normalized convolution.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Bluestein chirp identity
- [Coefficient (phase) twist](phase-twist.md): The map x_d ↦ ζy with ζ = e^{πi/r} that sends the cyclic last coordinate C[x_d]/(x_d^r−1) isomorphically to C[y]/(y^r+1) by multiplying coefficient k by ζ^k, so the negative wrap of the ring becomes the original cyclic wrap after untwisting.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Coefficient (phase) twist
- [Convolution over the polynomial ring](ring-convolution.md): Normalized convolution on d−1 axes of arrays with entries in C[y]/(y^r+1): two forward synthetic transforms keeping the same frequency order, pointwise polynomial products (by signed packing) divided by r, and the opposite transform, all using the fast layers and chunk swaps.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Convolution over the polynomial ring
- [Rounding and carry propagation](exact-recovery.md): The final steps that rescale by known factors (S, 2^{2b+4}), prove the accumulated coefficient error is below 1/2 so rounding gives the exact integer coefficients, and propagate radix-2^b carries to produce the 2n-bit product.
  Shown as: The multiplication algorithm *<predicate>* Rounding and carry propagation
- [Parameter choices and prime source lengths](parameter-choice.md): The size parameters b=⌈log₂n⌉, precision p=6b, number of axes d=⌊b^ε⌋, chunk width K=⌊d^c⌋, padded size T≈n/b, power-of-two axis lengths t_i∈{r/2,r}, and distinct primes s_i just below t_i with T/2 < ∏s_i < T, chosen so resampling hypotheses and all tape lemmas apply.

## Pages that build on this one

- Cost accounting and the saving κ: Dividing every cost by V = Tp = Θ(n) gives a table of seven dominant powers of p (layout moves, chunk exchanges, simultaneous butterfly rounds, CRT layout, Gaussian line maps, chirps, packed products), each at most 1−2κ with κ = 2^{−182}, giving total O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}).
- Integer multiplication below n log n: A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two n-bit integers exactly in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) worst-case time with κ = 2^{−182}, disproving the n log n optimality conjecture; it works by reducing to convolution, using fast address interchange and fast simultaneous butterfly layers to save a power of the logarithm.

If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0036-write-multiplication-algorithm`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
