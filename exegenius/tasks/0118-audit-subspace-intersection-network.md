# exegenius task 0118-audit-subspace-intersection-network

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

A term, symbol or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term, symbol or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- symbol: notation used without being defined on the page.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Subset-intersection subspace construction

The subset-intersection construction gives each gate and terminal of a [linear network](linear-network-frames.md) a subspace of a fixed $m$-dimensional space. The subspaces at adjacent vertices are nested, and the change in dimension along an edge counts how many smaller operations that edge needs.

The labels are built from subsets of size three. Let $A$ and $B$ be such subsets. Their intersection $|A \cap B|$ is $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$. [Indicator vectors](indicator-vector.md) of the subsets are used to define the coefficients of the network. [Gather and scatter operations](gather-scatter.md) create coefficients that depend only on the intersection size, and auxiliary wires cancel the coefficients that should not appear. The paper notes that orthogonality of the indicator vectors is what allows the subspaces to be assigned consistently.

The construction has an earlier source. The [Frankl–Wilson construction](frankl-wilson-construction.md), as presented by Alon, represents complementary intersection graphs over different fields. At the prime $p = 2$, the subsets have size three, and the two polynomial evaluations are the intersection count modulo two and the intersection count minus one. The paper uses these two formulas, but changes the size of the ground set and expresses the second through a rational bilinear form.

The decisive property is a counting inequality. If the network has $W$ roles, the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s < W m$. A recursive call at parameter $f$ on a stream of volume $V/W$ therefore leads to $s$ calls, and the strict inequality gives the power saving described in the [rank saving](rank-saving-recursion.md) page.

The paper proves the subspace properties directly in its Section 3. The earlier results it cites supply ingredients, but not the subspace labels used in its network.
