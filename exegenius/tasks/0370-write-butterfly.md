# exegenius task 0370-write-butterfly

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Butterflies and the fast transform
Gloss: A two-point averaging/differencing step H₀(u,v) = ((u+v)/2, (u−v)/2) whose repeated use over address bits, with twiddle multiplications, computes a transform in log t layers.
Also called: transform levels

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Synthetic transforms over $\mathcal R_r$ on $d-1$ axes of lengths $t_i\in\{2^{\ell-1},2^\ell\}$ with outputs kept in a retained layout $LB$ cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$ with error less than $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}$. (on [Tape layout for synthetic transforms](transform-layout.md))
- The synthetic transform $F_t^-$ over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, with roots of unity $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$, is computed by decimation in frequency with outputs written in bit-reversed order, $B_tF_t^-$; the pointwise product keeps this order and the reverse procedure computes $F_t^+B_t^{-1}$, so no reordering is executed.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "the decimation-in-frequency step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$" (paper)

  > Write \[ H_0=\frac12\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}. \] The length-one procedure is the identity. For $t\geq2$, the decimation-in-frequency step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$ for $0\leq k<t/2$. The two outputs of $H_0$ occupy these same slots, whose high address bit is $b=0$ or $b=1$, respectively. Multiply the $b=1$ output by $\omega_t^{-k}$, and then apply the length-$t/2$ procedure separately within the two branches. This computes $F_t^-$ because, for $b\in\{0,1\}$, \begin{equation} (F_t^-z)_{2h+b} =\frac1{t/2}\sum_{k=0}^{t/2-1} (\omega_t^2)^{-hk}\omega_t^{-bk} \frac{z_k+(-1)^b z_{k+t/2}}2. \label{eq:synthetic-dif} \end{equation} To follow the recursion, name the original address-bit slots of an axis of length $t=2^a$ by $a-1,\ldots,0$, from most to least significant. For $0\leq s\leq a$, after $s$ levels the values of the first $s$ named slots are branch b

- "two-point butterfly operations" (paper)

  > In this representation, the transform calculation consists of address rearrangements, signed shifts, and two-point butterfly operations. Scanning an array of $\Theta(n)$ stored bits at each of $\Theta(\log n)$ transform levels already costs $\Theta(n\log n)$. We therefore need savings in both movement and arithmetic. Two tape procedures supply them; in both bounds, $V$ denotes the stored bit volume.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Why can the log n factor in n log n only be beaten here by making address movement and butterfly arithmetic cheaper, rather than by some other tweak of a standard FFT-style multiplier? What accounting of a standard transform on a tape machine leads to this?" got stuck at "Butterflies and the fast transform *computes* [Discrete Fourier transform](kur).": I could not decode the term Discrete Fourier transform. From this page I know only that the layers compute it. I did not open its page, so I do not know what it is. (stuck at the symbol level)

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 337 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 421 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

A butterfly is the two-point step $H_0(u,v)=(\frac{u+v}{2},\frac{u-v}{2})$ applied to a pair of values (here $u,v$ are just those two values). Here $t$ is the transform length, a power of two. Repeated over the address bits of an array, with twiddle multiplications between layers, it computes the [Discrete Fourier transform](dft.md) of an array in $\log_2 t$ layers instead of $t^2$ operations. Later transforms consist of address rearrangements, signed shifts and these steps <cite data-source="paper">two-point butterfly operations</cite>.

## One layer

Let $z_k$, for positions $0\le k<t$, be the input values, and let $\omega_t=e^{2\pi i/t}$. The transform is $(F_tz)_m=\frac1t\sum_j z_j\omega_t^{-jm}$, where $m$ is the output index. The decimation-in-frequency step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$ for $0\le k<t/2$ <cite data-source="paper">the decimation-in-frequency step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$</cite>; these positions differ exactly in the highest address bit. Splitting the sum over $j=k$ and $j=k+t/2$, since $\omega_t^{t/2}=-1$ the second part carries the factor $(-1)^m$. Write $m=2h+b$, where $b\in\{0,1\}$ is the lowest bit of $m$ and $h$ is the remaining index. Then
$$(F_tz)_{2h+b}=\frac1{t/2}\sum_{k=0}^{t/2-1}(\omega_t^2)^{-hk}\,\omega_t^{-bk}\,\frac{z_k+(-1)^bz_{k+t/2}}{2}.$$
The pair enters only through $\frac{z_k+z_{k+t/2}}2$ (for $b=0$) and $\frac{z_k-z_{k+t/2}}2$ (for $b=1$), the two outputs of $H_0$. Store them in the slots they came from, so the highest address bit now holds $b$. After multiplying the $b=1$ output by the twiddle factor $\omega_t^{-k}$, each branch needs the same transform of length $t/2$ with output index $h$, because $\omega_t^2$ is the primitive $(t/2)$-th root of unity.

## Recursion and output order

One layer of $t/2$ butterflies and $t/2$ twiddle multiplications reduces a length-$t$ transform to two independent length-$t/2$ transforms. After $\log_2 t$ layers every transform has length one, the identity, for $O(t\log t)$ operations in all.

Number the address bits from the highest down. Layer one leaves bit $0$ of $m$ in the highest address bit. Within each branch, layer two repeats the argument for $h$: it pairs entries differing in the next address bit and leaves bit $1$ of $m$ there. Inductively, each layer leaves the next higher bit of $m$ in the next lower address bit. The address bits from high to low therefore hold the bits of $m$ from low to high <cite data-source="paper">contain the frequency bits from low to high</cite>, so output $m$ lands at the bit-reversed position of $m$.

For $t=4$: the first layer forms $\frac{z_0\pm z_2}2$ and $\frac{z_1\pm z_3}2$ and multiplies the two differences by $1$ and $\omega_4^{-1}=-i$. The second layer applies $H_0$ to each pair. Output $m=1$ (bits $01$) sits in position $2$ (bits $10$).

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0370-write-butterfly.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0370-write-butterfly.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0370-write-butterfly` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0370-write-butterfly`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
