# exegenius task 0012-write-multitape-model

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/D3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Fixed multitape Turing machine model
Gloss: The cost model: one fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes, each step reading/writing one cell per tape and moving heads by at most one cell.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Two $n$-bit integers can be multiplied exactly on a fixed finite-tape machine in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Schönhage and Strassen conjectured that $n\log n$ is optimal, and Harvey and van der Hoeven reached $O(n\log n)$; the goal is to beat it. (on [Schönhage–Strassen n log n conjecture and history](nlogn-conjecture.md))
- Scanning $\Theta(n)$ stored bits at each of $\Theta(\log n)$ transform levels already costs $\Theta(n\log n)$, so savings are needed in both movement and arithmetic. (on [Address rearrangement cost on tapes](tape-address-rearrangement.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Schönhage–Strassen n log n conjecture and history: Schönhage and Strassen's O(n log n log log n) bound and conjecture that n log n is optimal, later met by Harvey–van der Hoeven's O(n log n).
- Address rearrangement cost on tapes: Moving data between address fields on tapes costs a scan per level; naive scanning gives Θ(n log n) over Θ(log n) levels.
- Elementary stream operations and controlled shifts: Linear-time scans on tapes: digit permutations, moves, and controlled shifts/fixed rational scalings of a field using earlier control fields; arrays stored in lexicographic order with a self-delimiting integer header code.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "A machine has one fixed finite alphabet and one fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes." (paper)

  > A machine has one fixed finite alphabet and one fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes. A step reads and writes at most one cell on each tape and moves each head by at most one cell. Fixed tracks and finitely many work tapes change time by a fixed factor. We distinguish moving one digit in a fixed radix, which needs a bounded number of scans, from interchanging fields whose numbers of digits grow. The latter permutation will be realized in Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} by computing XOR combinations of intermediate data streams. The present section supplies the elementary scans it uses. Every scan includes its counters and the return of its tape heads.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0012-write-multitape-model.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0012-write-multitape-model.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0012-write-multitape-model` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0012-write-multitape-model`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them.
