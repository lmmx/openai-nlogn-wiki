# exegenius task 0010-write-subspace-rank-saving

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

## This page

Concept: Subspace labels and the rank deficit
Gloss: Nested subspaces of a fixed bilinear space attached to gates and terminals make each edge cost its rank in smaller operations; the total s of these ranks is strictly less than W·m, where W is the wire count and m the label-space dimension.
Also called: rank saving

## This page in the argument

The step: Nested subspace labels on the gates and terminals make each edge cost its rank in smaller operations, and the total rank $s$ over all edges is strictly less than $Wm$, where $W$ is the number of wires and $m$ the dimension of the label space.
How: attach nested nondegenerate subspaces of a fixed bilinear space to every gate and terminal, then count the dimension lost edge by edge
Why: The cost of an edge is the dimension change of its label, so a small total loss of dimension gives the deficit. (the sources say so: "The saving will come from keeping the total dimension lost on decreasing" (paper))
Striking feature: The total rank $s$ falls strictly short of $Wm$, although the deficit is a tiny relative fraction; the page should explain why the decreasing edges are confined to the central wires so that the saving exists at all. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Every edge of the network joins comparable nondegenerate labels, and the only decreasing edges are the central-wire edges, each losing dimension $h$.
- The sum $s$ of the rational ranks of the edge differences is $W m-N+2L$ and is therefore less than $Wm$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $T_A(n)=O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce the product to a digit convolution computed by synthetic transforms, replace the address rearrangement and butterfly layers inside those transforms by two faster recursive tape procedures, then assemble, round and bound the cost (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](sub-nlogn-multiplication.md))
- Two recursive tape procedures, an address-chunk interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, run faster than the naive costs of address rearrangement and Fourier layers by a power of the width.; how: build the elementary tape tools, derive a general recursive power saving from a fixed linear network, and instantiate it twice, once for bits and once for complex values
- A fixed linear network that exchanges two banks of values, restores its scratch wires and has total edge rank $s<Wm$ yields a recursion whose cost per volume grows only like a fixed power $m^\tau$ with $\tau<1$ per multiplication of the parameter by $m$.; how: build the network from subset gates, carry arrays along it by frames, label its vertices by subspaces, and read off the recursion (on [Recursive power saving](recursive-power-saving.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.3.4a, S1.3.4b). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.3.4a**: Every edge of the network joins comparable nondegenerate labels, and the only decreasing edges are the central-wire edges, each losing dimension $h$.
Source: "Every edge joins comparable nondegenerate labels." (paper)
> \begin{lemma}\label{lem:motif-residuals} Every edge joins comparable nondegenerate labels. The only decreasing edges are the central-wire edges from time 3 to time 4; their dimension loss is $h$. Consequently, if $c$ is the number of central wires per invocation and $W$ the total number of wires, then \begin{equation} L=Ich,\qquad \sum_{e}\bigl|\dim U_{\mathrm{head}(e)}- \dim U_{\mathrm{tail}(e)}\bigr| =Wm-2N+2L. \label{eq:rank-budget-labels} \end{equation} For the binary label space, every nonzero orthogonal residual of an edge has an orthonormal basis. \end{lemma}

**S1.3.4b**: The sum $s$ of the rational ranks of the edge differences is $W m-N+2L$ and is therefore less than $Wm$.
Source: "The sum of the rational ranks of all edge differences is" (paper)
> \begin{proposition}\label{prop:bit-motif-interface} The bit network has $W_{\rm b}$ wires, uses only pointwise XOR gates, and sends its input vector to the permutation $\rho$ of that vector. Its rational matrices are common to all incidences of a gate and obey \[ M_{\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))}-M_{\mathrm{source}(w)}=I_m \quad\text{for every input role }w. \] The sum of the rational ranks of all edge differences is \begin{align} s_{\rm b} &=\sum_{e}\operatorname{rank}_{\mathbb Q} (M_{\mathrm{head}(e)}-M_{\mathrm{tail}(e)})\\ &=W_{\rm b}m-N+2L_{\rm b} =177176569088785861287000000<W_{\rm b}m. \end{align} \end{proposition}

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Frames: changing representation along a network](frames-network.md): Arrays replace scalars on wires; each vertex has an invertible frame operator D_v, edges apply D_v D_u^{-1}, and pointwise linear gates commute with the common frame, so the whole network acts as D_out S D_in^{-1}.
  Shown as: Subspace labels and the rank deficit *<predicate>* Frames: changing representation along a network
- [Three-element subset gates (copy, gather, scatter, side wires)](subset-intersection-gates.md): Fixed linear maps indexed by three-element subsets of {1..100} whose coefficients depend on intersection size; auxiliary side and center wires cancel the unwanted coefficients and are restored afterwards.

## Pages that build on this one

- Recursive power saving: A call at parameter m·f uses s calls at parameter f on streams of volume V/W, so cost per volume obeys F_k ≤ (s/W)F_{k−1} + O(1) with s/W < m, giving cost O(V e^τ) for some fixed τ < 1.
- Phase frames and the C kernel: Over Gaussian dyadic values, the phase frame changes between binary subspace labels are products of two-point kernels aI + bX_v (a=(1+i)/2, b=(1−i)/2), one per orthonormal residual vector, and telescope to C^{⊗m} on every role.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$." (paper)

  > The finite construction in Section~\ref{sec:finite-networks} attaches subspaces of a fixed $m$-dimensional space to its gates and terminals. The subspaces at adjacent vertices are nested. Their dimension changes count the smaller operations needed on an edge, with an additional source contribution in the bit construction. The construction uses three-element subsets: gather and scatter create coefficients depending on intersection size, and auxiliary wires cancel the unwanted coefficients. Orthogonality of the corresponding indicator vectors permits the subspace assignments. The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.

- "orthogonal residual" (paper)

  > The scalar network already has the required signed exchange. We now choose its intermediate labels to make the changes of frame inexpensive. A label is a nondegenerate subspace of a fixed bilinear space. On every edge one label will contain the other. For such an edge, the \emph{orthogonal residual} is the orthogonal complement of the smaller label inside the larger one; its dimension is the absolute change in label dimension. The saving will come from keeping the total dimension lost on decreasing edges small relative to $N$.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-subspace-rank-saving.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-subspace-rank-saving.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0010-write-subspace-rank-saving` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-subspace-rank-saving`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
