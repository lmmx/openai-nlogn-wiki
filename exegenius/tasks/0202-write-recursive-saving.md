# exegenius task 0202-write-recursive-saving

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Rank-saving recursion
Gloss: A recursive scheme in which an edge matrix of rank a costs a smaller calls and the total number s of smaller calls over W roles satisfies s < Wm, so that multiplying the parameter by m multiplies the cost by less than m per unit volume.
Also called: recursive saving, recursive scheme, edge matrix

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The decisive property is that the total" (paper)

  > The finite construction in Section~\ref{sec:finite-networks} attaches subspaces of a fixed $m$-dimensional space to its gates and terminals. The subspaces at adjacent vertices are nested. Their dimension changes count the smaller operations needed on an edge, with an additional source contribution in the bit construction. The construction uses three-element subsets: gather and scatter create coefficients depending on intersection size, and auxiliary wires cancel the unwanted coefficients. Orthogonality of the corresponding indicator vectors permits the subspace assignments. The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- $a$ means edge rank here, but real part on [Gaussian dyadic numbers](gaussian-dyadic.md), which this page builds on: Rename the edge rank (for example to rk(e)), since a is the real part of a Gaussian dyadic number on the dyadic page.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 248 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 310 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

Rank-saving recursion is a recursive scheme that runs on a [linear network](linear-network.md). It pays for each edge of the network with smaller calls, and it keeps the total number of those calls below a fixed bound, which is what gives [fast interchange of address chunks](tape-interchange.md) its saving.

An edge matrix is the matrix that says what one edge of the network does to the values it carries. Write $a$ for the rank of one edge matrix. Summing $a$ over all edges gives the total number of smaller calls, $s$. <cite data-source="paper">The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$.</cite>

The recursion is stated in the [frame of a vertex](frame.md) at each end of an edge, where the frame is the invertible linear operator that fixes how the array on that vertex's wires is stored. The recursion splits its array into [role streams from a cyclic row split](role-streams.md) across the $W$ roles, the fixed wire places of the network. Each role therefore holds an equal share $V/W$ of the padded volume $V$, and each smaller call acts on one such share.

The cost is measured by [nested subspace labels](subspace-labels.md) on the edges. Each vertex gets a subspace of a fixed $m$-dimensional space, adjacent subspaces are nested, and the drop in dimension across an edge measures the smaller calls that edge needs.

The finite construction of the paper uses three-element subsets, with gather and scatter wires, and it has the property that the total satisfies $s<Wm$. <cite data-source="paper">The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.</cite> So on average each role makes fewer than $m$ smaller calls.

The paper uses this bound for interchange. <cite data-source="paper">Because the sum of these ranks is less than the number of wires times $m$, the resulting recurrence saves a power of the chunk width.</cite>
