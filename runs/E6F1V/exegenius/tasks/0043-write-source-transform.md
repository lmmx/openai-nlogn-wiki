Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F1V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Source transform procedure
Gloss: Computes the transform of coprime length by applying the Gaussian map A line by line, the chirp transform through complex convolution, the map B₀, and an exact power-of-two scale, with the retained permutation R.

## This page in the argument

The step: The computed source transform $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ approximates $\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A=RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ on disk-grid tensors of norm at most $.5$.
How: Apply the Gaussian map $A$ line by line, the chirp transform through the complex convolution, the map $B_0$, and an exact power-of-two scale.
Why: This is the Gaussian-resampling identity executed with the chirp identity supplying the middle transform. (the sources do not say this: give the reader the reason)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The chirp transform forms $x_0=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)$, then $y_0=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0)$, then $Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot y_0)$.
- The source transform applies $\mathcal A$, the chirp transform and $\mathcal B_0$ and multiplies the numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$; its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$.
- The opposite-sign procedure $\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}$ has exact counterpart $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- There is one deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine multiplying $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce the product to a digit convolution computed with Fourier-type transforms on power-of-two axes, and accelerate the transforms' address rearrangements and butterfly layers by a power of the logarithm. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- With $p=6b$, $d=\lfloor b^\epsilon\rfloor$, $K$, $r$, $T$ and the tiny exponents fixed, the multiplication algorithm is correct and runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time.; how: Fix compatible parameters, present the algorithm built from the transform machinery, prove the recovered coefficients round correctly, and add up the cost rows. (on [Parameter choice and cost balance](parameter-balance.md))
- The algorithm splits both inputs into radix-$2^b$ digits, applies $\Phi$, computes the source transform of each, multiplies pointwise, applies the opposite transform with scalings, rounds and propagates carries to output exactly $2n$ bits.; how: Reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of digit lists on coprime axes and evaluate it by the transform, pointwise product and inverse transform with the retained permutation cancelling. (on [The multiplication algorithm](mult-algorithm.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (PB.3.4.1, PB.3.4.2, PB.3.4.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**PB.3.4.1**: The chirp transform forms $x_0=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot x)$, then $y_0=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0)$, then $Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\cdot y_0)$.
Source: "x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x)," (paper)
> Let $\widetilde a$ be the resulting disk-grid array, so $\|\widetilde a-a\|_\infty<2\,2^{-p}$. For a disk-grid target tensor $x$ of norm at most $.6$, the computed chirp transform forms the arrays \[ \begin{aligned} x_0&=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}x),\\ y_0&=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(\widetilde a,x_0),\\ \widetilde{\mathscr C}(x) &=Q_p(\overline{\widetilde a}\mathbin{\cdot}y_0). \end{aligned} \] Thus $\widetilde a$ is the convolution kernel and $x_0$ is the data operand after the first endpoint phase. Replacing the approximations by exact phases and exact convolution gives $\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}\mathcal M_{\mathbb C} (a,\overline a\mathbin{\cdot}x)=QF_{\boldsymbol t}x$ by \eqref{eq:permuted-chirp}. Below we show that $\|x\|_\infty\le.6$ implies $\|x_0\|_\infty\le.6$, which supplies the smaller operand required by the computed convolution.

**PB.3.4.2**: The source transform applies $\mathcal A$, the chirp transform and $\mathcal B_0$ and multiplies the numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$; its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$.
Source: "\mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A" (paper)
> For a source disk-grid tensor of norm at most $.5$, write $\widetilde{\mathscr F}$ for the following procedure: apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal A$, apply the computed chirp transform $\widetilde{\mathscr C}$, apply the linewise approximation to $\mathcal B_0$, and multiply the grid numerators exactly by $2^\gamma$. Its exact counterpart is \[ \mathscr F=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A =RF_{\boldsymbol s}. \] Here an exact counterpart replaces every numerical subroutine by the exact map it approximates and omits truncations. The source arrays are stored in the padded power-of-two box, with zeros outside the valid source coordinates. The compressed scalar output uses $w_{\rm c}$-bit components. Appending $\gamma$ zero bits to each word gives the exact scaled numerator in the known signed width $w_{\rm c}+\gamma$. For the stated input norm, the disk estimate below proves that every scaled coordinate still belongs to $\mathbb D_p$. Its component numerators therefore have magnitude at most $2^p$, so a scan removes only leading sign-extension bits and returns the same integers in $w_{\rm c}$ bits. This scan costs $O(T(w_{\rm c}+\gamma))=O(Tp)$ and leaves the padded zero records zero. Define the opposite-sign procedure by \[ \widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z) =\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}; \] its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}.

**PB.3.4.3**: The opposite-sign procedure $\overline{\widetilde{\mathscr F}(\overline z)}$ has exact counterpart $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$.
Source: "its exact counterpart is $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ by" (paper)

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0043-write-source-transform`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
