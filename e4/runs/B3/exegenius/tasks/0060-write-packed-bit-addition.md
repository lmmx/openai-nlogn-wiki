Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e4/B3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is an undergraduate computer scientist: fluent with big-O and basic algorithm analysis (recurrences, divide and conquer, sorting and merging, schoolbook multiplication), discrete mathematics (sets, binomial coefficients, permutations, modular arithmetic, primes, gcd), and introductory linear algebra and complex numbers including roots of unity and polynomial arithmetic.

## This page

Concept: Packed addition of selected address bits
Gloss: A binary row addition on corresponding selected bits of two address chunks, using a third chunk as restored scratch, is done by eight packed cyclic shifts plus deterministic repair of an exponentially small set of exceptional addresses.

## This page in the argument

The step: A binary row addition on corresponding selected bits of two address chunks, with a third chunk restored, costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ by eight packed cyclic shifts and deterministic repair of an exponentially small set of exceptional addresses.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce multiplication to a convolution computed by Gaussian-resampling, Bluestein and synthetic transforms, accelerate the address movement and butterfly layers by two network-based tape procedures, and add up the costs (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Applying $H_0$ to the same bit position in $d$ address chunks of polynomial records at once, exactly in Gaussian dyadics with a single final truncation, costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$.; how: reduce the layer to $C$ kernels, implement the basis changes by packed chunk operations, run the network recursively on role streams, and bound the dyadic growth (on [Simultaneous butterfly layer in O(V d^λ′) time](simultaneous-layer.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Chunk interchange in O(V uᵗ) time](chunk-interchange.md): Interchanging two disjoint u-bit address fields of an array in which all address combinations occur costs O(V u^τ) for a fixed τ<1, via XOR-style intermediate steps whose final effect is an exact permutation.
  Shown as: Packed addition of selected address bits *<predicate>* Chunk interchange in O(V uᵗ) time
- [Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings](controlled-shift.md): Updating a later address field y by y+a(controls) mod q^b, or multiplying it by a fixed rational unit, costs O(V) on tape by splitting each fibre in two pieces and merging them in swapped order.
  Shown as: Packed addition of selected address bits *<predicate>* Controlled cyclic shifts and fixed rational scalings

## Pages that build on this one

- Simultaneous butterfly layer in O(V d^λ′) time: Applying H₀ to the same bit position in d address chunks of polynomial records at once, exactly in Gaussian dyadics with guard bits and one final truncation, costs O(V d^{λ′}) with λ′<1 instead of d passes.

  > \begin{lemma}[Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle] \label{lem:packed-selected-bit-rectangle} Let $R\ge1$, $K\ge6$, $f\ge1$, $L=fK$, and $0\le\rho<K$. Let $N_0,N_1,N_2,N_3$ be positive integers, and let $(\chi_1,\chi_2,\chi_3)$ be a permutation of $(x,y,z)$. Consider $R$-bit records in lexicographic order on \[ [N_0]\times[2^L]_{\chi_1}\times[N_1]\times[2^L]_{\chi_2} \times[N_2]\times[2^L]_{\chi_3}\times[N_3]. \] The subscript names the chunk at that position. The input supplies $N_0,\ldots,N_3,R,K,f,\rho$ as a fixed number of canonical binary integers, together with the finite permutation of the chunk names, as in Section~\ref{sec:streams}.

  > <K$. Let $N_0,N_1,N_2,N_3$ be positive integers, and let $(\chi_1,\chi_2,\chi_3)$ be a permutation of $(x,y,z)$. Consider $R$-bit records in lexicographic order on \[ [N_0]\times[2^L]_{\chi_1}\times[N_1]\times[2^L]_{\chi_2} \times[N_2]\times[2^L]_{\chi_3}\times[N_3]. \] The subscript names the chunk at that position. The input supplies $N_0,\ldots,N_3,R,K,f,\rho$ as a fixed number of canonical binary integers, together with the finite permutation of the chunk names, as in Section~\ref{sec:streams}. Put \[ M=2^{3L}\prod_{h=0}^3N_h,\qquad V=MR,\qquad A_{\rm rect}=\lceil\log_2(2V)\rceil. \] At the selected positions $j_i=\rho+iK$, numbered from the least significant bit, one fixed multitape procedure performs \[ y_{j_i}\longleftarrow y_{j_i}\mathbin\oplus x_{j_i} \quad(0\le i<f). \] It preserves the spectator coordinates, all other chunk bits, and every record payload; in particular, it restores the entire chunk $z$ for every initial value. With $\delta_{\rm bad}=\min\{1,80(f-1)2^{-K}\}$, its time is \begin{equation} \label{eq:packed-rectangle-time} O\!\left(V(L^\tau+1)+MA_{\rm rect}^3+ \delta_{\rm bad}MA_{\rm rect}(R+A_{\rm rect})\right). \end{equation} When $A_{\rm rect}=O(p)$, $R$ exceeds every fixed polynomial in $p$, $f\le d\le p$, and $K/\log p\to\infty$, this is $O(V(L^\tau+1))$, uniformly over the permitted lengths and payloads in the fixed family. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0060-write-packed-bit-addition.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0060-write-packed-bit-addition.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0060-write-packed-bit-addition` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0060-write-packed-bit-addition`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
