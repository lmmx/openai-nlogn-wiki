# exegenius task 0005-write-convolution-dft

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/B2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Convolution and discrete Fourier transform
Gloss: Integer multiplication reduces to convolution of digit lists, which Fourier transforms compute through pointwise products; normalized transforms are contractions.

## This page in the argument

The step: Splitting inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients, computed by Fourier transforms.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce multiplication to convolution, accelerate the tape procedures by a power saving, then chain the reductions to an exact product (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)) time](main-theorem.md))

## Pages that build on this one

- Harvey–van der Hoeven O(n log n) multiplication: The established unconditional O(n log n) multiplier, used only as an ordinary subroutine for polynomial products.
- Synthetic polynomial transforms: Fourier-type transforms over the polynomial ring using powers of y as roots, built from address rearrangements, signed shifts and two-point butterflies.
- Chinese-remainder address map: Places the digit list on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes, preserving convolution.
- Gaussian resampling: Harvey–van der Hoeven reduction expressing a Fourier transform through a multidimensional transform with power-of-two axis lengths.
- Bluestein chirp conversion: Converts the middle transform, with its target permutation, into a normalized cyclic convolution.
- Rounding and carry propagation: After removing normalizations, the recovered coefficient error is below 1/2, so rounding and carries give the exact binary product.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients." (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

- "Each normalized Fourier transform above is a contraction" (paper)

  > For an integer $q\geq 1$, write \[ (F_q u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{-2\pi i jk/q}, \qquad (F_q^+ u)_k=\frac1q\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}u_j e^{2\pi i jk/q}. \] All subscripts on a vector of length $q$ are taken modulo $q$. The vector norm is the maximum modulus of its coordinates. All operator norms are induced by this norm: $\|L\|=\sup_{\|u\|\leq1}\|Lu\|$. Each normalized Fourier transform above is a contraction, since each output averages inputs multiplied by complex numbers of modulus one. Coordinate permutations preserve the norm. For an integer precision $p\geq1$, put \[ \mathbb D_p=\{2^{-p}(a+ib):a,b\in\mathbb Z,\ a^2+b^2\leq 2^{2p}\}. \] For storage between completed scalar routines, put $w_{\rm c}=p+2$. Represent $2^{-p}(a+ib)\in\mathbb D_p$ by a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit two's-complement word for $a$, followed by one for $b$, with each word written most significant bit first. A coordinate list is the concatenation of these fixed-length records in its stated order. Since $|a|,|b|\leq2^p<2^{w_{\rm c}-1}$, this format includes both signs of every permitted numerator, including $-2^p$ and $2^p$. An approximation $\wid
