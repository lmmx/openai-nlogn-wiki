Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F5B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, counting, induction, primes, gcd), a first algorithms course (divide and conquer, recurrences, sorting, Karatsuba multiplication, schoolbook arithmetic) and complexity (big-O family, single- and multitape Turing machines), together with calculus (exponentials, logarithms, series), linear algebra over the reals and complex numbers, and polynomials.

## This page

Concept: Subspace labels and the rank budget
Gloss: Each gate and terminal of the network gets a nested nondegenerate subspace of an m-dimensional space, so an edge costs its dimension change, and the only decreasing edges are central wires, keeping the total below the wire count times m.

## This page in the argument

The step: Each gate and terminal gets a nested nondegenerate subspace of the $m$-dimensional space so that the only decreasing edges are the central wires between times 3 and 4, losing dimension $h$ each, and the summed dimension change is $Wm-2N+2L$ with $L<N/2$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- Two $n$-bit integers are multiplied exactly by one deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution of short radix-digit polynomials, evaluate it through Gaussian resampling, Bluestein chirps and synthetic polynomial transforms, and speed up the data movement and butterfly arithmetic of those transforms with two procedures built from linear networks with a rank saving, then verify exactness and the total cost. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures save a power: address chunks of $u$ bits are interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time and a common butterfly layer on $D\le d$ chunks is applied in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time, with fixed $\tau,\lambda'<1$.; how: Build both procedures from fixed linear networks whose total edge rank is smaller than the wire count times the label dimension, so that a recursion on smaller calls on smaller volumes saves a power of the width.
- Two fixed linear networks exchange two banks of values with prescribed signs while restoring every scratch value, and carry subspace labels whose total edge rank $s$ is less than $Wm$.; how: Construct the scalar gate schedule and show how frames turn it into an operator on arrays, attach nested nondegenerate subspaces as labels so that dimension changes count the cost of edges, and read off the bit and phase interfaces and the resulting recurrence.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Three-subset gather and scatter network](subset-intersection-network.md): A fixed network on banks indexed by triples of 3-subsets whose gather, scatter, copy and side-injection gates have net coefficient depending on intersection size, cancelled by scratch wires, so three stages realize the signed exchange (X, Y) ↦ (−Y, X).
  Shown as: Subspace labels and the rank budget *<predicate>* Three-subset gather and scatter network
- [Nondegenerate subspaces and orthogonal residuals](nondegenerate-subspaces.md): Subspaces of a bilinear space on which the form is nondegenerate, so the space splits as a subspace plus its orthogonal complement; the orthogonal residual of nested subspaces is the complement of the smaller inside the larger.
  Shown as: Subspace labels and the rank budget *<predicate>* Nondegenerate subspaces and orthogonal residuals
- [Role networks and frames](gate-network-frames.md): A fixed linear network of wires (roles) and pointwise gates is run on arrays; assigning each vertex an invertible frame D_v makes the implemented operator D_out S D_in⁻¹, so only changes of frame along edges cost work.
  Shown as: Subspace labels and the rank budget *<predicate>* Role networks and frames

## Pages that build on this one

- Rank saving and the power-saving recurrence: If a network of W wires has total edge rank s < W m, a call at parameter m·f makes s calls on streams of volume V/W at parameter f, so per-volume cost obeys F_k ≤ (s/W) F_{k−1} + O(1) and grows only like e^τ with τ < 1.
- Bit network as an address shear: Using projection matrices of the labels as frames, the XOR network turns the role exchange into the shear H ← H + D on every role, with total rational edge rank s_b < W_b m.
- Binary phase frames: For the complex network with binary labels, the frame C_U = H^{⊗m} diag(i^{wt(P_U x) mod 4}) H^{⊗m} makes each edge change a product of one two-point kernel aI + bX_v per residual basis vector, and the whole network equals C^{⊗m} on every role.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The saving will come from keeping the total dimension lost on decreasing edges small relative to $N$." (paper)

  > The scalar network already has the required signed exchange. We now choose its intermediate labels to make the changes of frame inexpensive. A label is a nondegenerate subspace of a fixed bilinear space. On every edge one label will contain the other. For such an edge, the \emph{orthogonal residual} is the orthogonal complement of the smaller label inside the larger one; its dimension is the absolute change in label dimension. The saving will come from keeping the total dimension lost on decreasing edges small relative to $N$.

- "Every edge joins comparable nondegenerate labels." (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}\label{lem:motif-residuals} Every edge joins comparable nondegenerate labels. The only decreasing edges are the central-wire edges from time 3 to time 4; their dimension loss is $h$. Consequently, if $c$ is the number of central wires per invocation and $W$ the total number of wires, then \begin{equation} L=Ich,\qquad \sum_{e}\bigl|\dim U_{\mathrm{head}(e)}- \dim U_{\mathrm{tail}(e)}\bigr| =Wm-2N+2L. \label{eq:rank-budget-labels} \end{equation} For the binary label space, every nonzero orthogonal residual of an edge has an orthonormal basis. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0015-write-subspace-labels.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0015-write-subspace-labels.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0015-write-subspace-labels` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0015-write-subspace-labels`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
