Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/W2WHP14` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Coefficient (phase) twist
Gloss: The map x_d ↦ ζy with ζ = e^{πi/r} that sends the cyclic last coordinate C[x_d]/(x_d^r−1) isomorphically to C[y]/(y^r+1) by multiplying coefficient k by ζ^k, so the negative wrap of the ring becomes the original cyclic wrap after untwisting.
Also called: twist

## This page in the argument

The step: Coefficient twist: $\Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\to\mathcal R_r$, $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ with $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$, multiplies coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^k$, and the negative wrap of $\mathcal R_r$ becomes the original cyclic wrap after untwisting; hence $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=(f*g)/T$.
How: Check that $(\zeta y)^r=1$ so $\Theta$ is well defined, that it is diagonal and invertible, and that a wrapped term acquires the factor $\zeta^j$.
Why: The sources obtain the power-of-two complex convolution of the chirp identity from the synthetic convolution by a coefficient twist. (the sources say so: "obtained from the synthetic convolution by a coefficient twist." (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- $\Theta$ is the algebra map sending $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$.
- It is well defined since $(\zeta y)^r=(-1)(-1)=1$, diagonal on bases $(x_d^k)$ and $(y^k)$ with entries $\zeta^k\ne0$, hence an isomorphism with inverse multiplying coefficient $k$ by $\zeta^{-k}$; both maps preserve the sup norm.
- Wrap check: writing $k+l=j+hr$ with $h\in\{0,1\}$, a product term has factor $\zeta^{k+l}(-1)^h=\zeta^j(\zeta^r)^h(-1)^h=\zeta^j$, so untwisting recovers the cyclic coefficient with the correct sign.
- With $(D_\pm f)_{\boldsymbol j,k}=\zeta^{\pm k}f_{\boldsymbol j,k}$ and $\iota$ identifying the tensor with $M$ ring records, normalized complex convolution is $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g):=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=(f*g)/T$, a bilinear contraction.
- Computed version: $f'=Q_p(\widetilde\theta^+\cdot f)$, $g'=Q_p(\widetilde\theta^+\cdot g)$, $h'=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_r(\iota f',\iota g')$, output $Q_p(\widetilde\theta^-\cdot\iota^{-1}h')$, with twist factors $\zeta^{\pm k}$ computed to error below $2\cdot2^{-p}$ in $O(p^{1+\delta})$ per factor.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution of short integer coefficients, evaluate the convolution through power-of-two transforms over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, and replace the two tape operations that each cost a factor $\log n$ (address rearrangement and butterfly layers) by procedures whose cost per bit is a power of their parameter below one; then total the costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- The multiplication algorithm: form base-$2^b$ digits, place them on distinct prime cyclic axes by the Chinese-remainder map $\Phi$, run two source transforms (Gaussian resampling plus chirp convolution through a twisted ring convolution), multiply pointwise, run the opposite transform, rescale, round and propagate carries, obtaining the exact $2n$-bit product in $O(Tp)$ steps beyond the layer costs.; how: Choose compatible parameters, reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of digit coefficients, evaluate the convolution through Gaussian-resampled transforms with all permutations left in the formulas, and recover exact integer coefficients from the approximations by an error bound below one half. (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S8.4.1, S8.4.2, S8.4.3, S8.4.4, S8.4.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S8.4.1**: $\Theta$ is the algebra map sending $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$.
Source: "x_d\longmapsto\zeta y" (paper)
> The power-of-two complex convolution used in the chirp identity is obtained from the synthetic convolution by a coefficient twist. Put $\mathcal R=\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ and $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$. The map \[ \Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\longrightarrow\mathcal R, \qquad x_d\longmapsto\zeta y \] is well defined, since $(\zeta y)^r=(-1)(-1)=1$. On the bases $(x_d^k)_{0\le k<r}$ and $(y^k)_{0\le k<r}$ it is diagonal, multiplying coefficient $k$ by the nonzero number $\zeta^k$. It is therefore an isomorphism, with inverse multiplying that coefficient by $\zeta^{-k}$. Both exact maps preserve the coefficient sup norm. For an explicit check on the wrap, write $k+l=j+hr$, where $h\in\{0,1\}$. A product term after twisting and negacyclic reduction has factor \[ \zeta^{k+l}(-1)^h=\zeta^j(\zeta^r)^h(-1)^h=\zeta^j. \] Untwisting therefore recovers the cyclic coefficient with the correct sign. We next specify how this linewise map meets the ring-convolution interface. Put $M=\prod_{i<d}t_i=T/r$. For a complex array $f$

> ity is obtained from the synthetic convolution by a coefficient twist. Put $\mathcal R=\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ and $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$.

For a complex array $f$ on $\prod_{i=1}^d\mathbb Z/t_i\mathbb Z$, with $t_d=r$, define \[ (\iota f)_{\boldsymbol j} =\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}f_{\boldsymbol j,k}y^k, \qquad \boldsymbol j\in\prod_{i<d}\mathbb Z/t_i\mathbb Z. \] This identifies the scalar tensor with an array of $M$ records in $\mathcal R$. As maps of values, $\iota$ and $\iota^{-1}$ preserve norms and grids. Write $(D_\pm f)_{\boldsymbol j,k}=\zeta^{\pm k}f_{\boldsymbol j,k}$. The linewise extension of $\Theta$ is $\iota D_+$, with inverse $D_-\iota^{-1}$. Consequentl

**S8.4.4**: With $(D_\pm f)_{\boldsymbol j,k}=\zeta^{\pm k}f_{\boldsymbol j,k}$ and $\iota$ identifying the tensor with $M$ ring records, normalized complex convolution is $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g):=D_-\iota^{-1}\mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g)=(f*g)/T$, a bilinear contraction.
Source: ":=D_-\iota^{-1}" (paper)
> the ring-convolution interface. Put $M=\prod_{i<d}t_i=T/r$. For a complex array $f$ on $\prod_{i=1}^d\mathbb Z/t_i\mathbb Z$, with $t_d=r$, define \[ (\iota f)_{\boldsymbol j} =\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}f_{\boldsymbol j,k}y^k, \qquad \boldsymbol j\in\prod_{i<d}\mathbb Z/t_i\mathbb Z. \] This identifies the scalar tensor with an array of $M$ records in $\mathcal R$. As maps of values, $\iota$ and $\iota^{-1}$ preserve norms and grids. Write $(D_\pm f)_{\boldsymbol j,k}=\zeta^{\pm k}f_{\boldsymbol j,k}$. The linewise extension of $\Theta$ is $\iota D_+$, with inverse $D_-\iota^{-1}$. Consequently, with $\mathcal M_r$ from Section~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products}, normalized complex cyclic convolution is \[ \mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g) :=D_-\iota^{-1} \mathcal M_r(\iota D_+f,\iota D_+g) =\frac{f*g}{T}. \] Here $\mathcal M_r$ convolves the first $d-1$ axes over $\mathcal R$, whereas $*$ on the right convolves all $d$ scalar axes. The division by $T$ is already part of $\mathcal M_r$. The maps $D_\pm$ and $\iota^{\pm1}$ are isometries, so $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}$ is also a bilinear contraction.

**S8.4.5**: Computed version: $f'=Q_p(\widetilde\theta^+\cdot f)$, $g'=Q_p(\widetilde\theta^+\cdot g)$, $h'=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_r(\iota f',\iota g')$, output $Q_p(\widetilde\theta^-\cdot\iota^{-1}h')$, with twist factors $\zeta^{\pm k}$ computed to error below $2\cdot2^{-p}$ in $O(p^{1+\delta})$ per factor.
Source: "f'&=Q_p(\widetilde\theta^+\mathbin{\cdot}f),\\" (paper)
> For $0\le k<r$, obtain disk-grid approximations $\widetilde\theta_k^+$ and $\widetilde\theta_k^-$ to $\zeta^k$ and $\zeta^{-k}$, each with error less than $2\,2^{-p}$. The exponential routine uses denominator $2r$ and costs $O(p^{1+\delta})$ per factor. Write $\widetilde{\mathcal M}_r$ for the procedure in Proposition~\ref{prop:synthetic-convolution}. For disk-grid inputs $f,g$, one of norm at most $.7$, the computed complex convolution is the following sequence, with the twist arrays repeated on every last-coordinate line: \[ \begin{aligned} f'&=Q_p(\widetilde\theta^+\mathbin{\cdot}f),\\ g'&=Q_p(\widetilde\theta^+\mathbin{\cdot}g),\\ h'&=\widetilde{\mathcal M}_r(\iota f',\iota g'),\\ \widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(f,g) &=Q_p\!\left(\widetilde\theta^-\mathbin{\cdot} \iota^{-1}h'\right). \end{aligned} \] Each phase product is computed exactly as a dyadic product before $Q_p$ truncates its two components. The factors and disk operands have numerators of magnitude at most $2^p$; four signed integer products and their sums therefore use $O(p)$ bits. Truncation shifts the absolute component numerators right by $p$ places and restores their signs, then writes the resulting disk-grid value in the $w_{\rm c}$-bit component format. It costs $O(p^{1+\delta})$ per coefficient. Generating every factor anew therefore still gives total twist cost $O(Tp^{1+\delta})$. The precision calculation below proves that these calls return disk-grid arrays.

- "is well defined, since $(\zeta y)^r=(-1)(-1)=1$." (paper)

  > The power-of-two complex convolution used in the chirp identity is obtained from the synthetic convolution by a coefficient twist. Put $\mathcal R=\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ and $\zeta=e^{\pi i/r}$. The map \[ \Theta:\mathbb C[x_d]/(x_d^r-1)\longrightarrow\mathcal R, \qquad x_d\longmapsto\zeta y \] is well defined, since $(\zeta y)^r=(-1)(-1)=1$. On the bases $(x_d^k)_{0\le k<r}$ and $(y^k)_{0\le k<r}$ it is diagonal, multiplying coefficient $k$ by the nonzero number $\zeta^k$. It is therefore an isomorphism, with inverse multiplying that coefficient by $\zeta^{-k}$. Both exact maps preserve the coefficient sup norm.

- "A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial" (paper)

  > Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution. A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$; its negative wrap gives precisely the original cyclic wrap after the twist is removed. Sections~\ref{sec:synthetic-layouts} and~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products} compute convolution on the remaining axes over this polynomial ring. The two forward synthetic transforms retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes that order. Their polynomial products use signed packing and the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-phase-twist.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-phase-twist.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0022-write-phase-twist` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-phase-twist`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
