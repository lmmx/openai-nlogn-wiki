Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F8V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Gaussian resampling
Gloss: Harvey–van der Hoeven's way to compute a Fourier transform of prime length s from one of power-of-two length t>s using Gaussian-weighted linear maps A and B₀ that are contractions.

## This page in the argument

The step: A Fourier transform of prime length $s$ equals $2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$ for a power-of-two length $t>s$ with Gaussian contractions $A$ and $B_0$ and with the coordinate permutations kept in the formula; on $d$ axes this tensors to $RF_{\boldsymbol s}=2^{\gamma}\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A$.
How: Use the Gaussian resampling identity of Harvey and van der Hoeven, normalise the resampling maps so they are contractions, keep the permutations $P_s,P_t$ explicit, and apply the one-dimensional maps line by line on the padded box.
Why: The tensor transform on a growing number of axes is built from one-dimensional maps applied along one coordinate line at a time, with axis movement done by chunk interchanges. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: The Gaussian identity keeps both coordinate permutations in the transform formula, so no sort of the data is performed to resample. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- There are linear contractions $A:\mathbb C^s\to\mathbb C^t$ and $B_0:\mathbb C^t\to\mathbb C^s$ built from the Gaussian maps.
- They satisfy $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$ with the permutations $P_s,P_t$ left in the identity.
- Approximations $\widetilde A,\widetilde B_0$ with error below $p^2$ run in time $O(tp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ on a line of length $t$.
- Tensoring over $d$ axes gives $RF_{\boldsymbol s}=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A$ with $\gamma=2d\alpha^2$.
- The linewise implementations have error below $dp^2$ and total time $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ over the padded box.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Build two faster tape procedures (address chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) from rank-saving linear networks, use them in synthetic polynomial transforms and resampled source transforms for a convolution, reduce integer multiplication to that convolution, then prove exactness and add up costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- A source Fourier transform on pairwise coprime (prime) lengths can be computed through power-of-two transforms, with the middle transform as a chirp convolution and with the coordinate permutations cancelling rather than being executed.; how: Use Gaussian resampling to pass from prime lengths to power-of-two lengths, Bluestein's chirp to turn the middle transform into a cyclic convolution, and an algebraic cancellation of the retained permutations.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (F.1.1, F.1.2, F.1.3, F.1.4, F.1.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**F.1.1**: There are linear contractions $A:\mathbb C^s\to\mathbb C^t$ and $B_0:\mathbb C^t\to\mathbb C^s$ built from the Gaussian maps.

## Pages that build on this one

- Retained permutation cancellation: The coordinate permutations of resampling are kept in the transform formula; the source permutation cancels between the two forward transforms, the pointwise product and the opposite-sign transform, so no full sorts are executed.
- Parameter regime for the multiplier: The choice of precision p=6b, dimension d≈p^ε, record length r=2^Θ(p^(1−ε)), power-of-two axis lengths t_i and distinct prime source lengths s_i just below them, so that Tp=Θ(n) and all hypotheses hold.
- Source transform on the padded box: The approximate source Fourier transform formed by linewise Gaussian maps A, the chirp convolution of length T on the padded power-of-two box, linewise B₀ and an exact 2^γ scale, equal to R F_s on the prime-length source.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Gaussian resampling then expresses each source Fourier transform through a power-of-two tensor transform." (paper)

  > The remaining proof places these procedures inside the multiplication reduction and accounts for every change of representation. First, the radix-digit coefficient list is placed on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map that preserves convolution. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} implements this map through triangular controlled shifts and charged axis moves. Gaussian resampling then expresses each source Fourier transform through a power-of-two tensor transform. Section~\ref{sec:resampling} retains the source and target coordinate permutations in the transform identity, so they need not be executed as separate full sorts.

- "it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0031-write-gaussian-resampling.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0031-write-gaussian-resampling.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0031-write-gaussian-resampling` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0031-write-gaussian-resampling`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
