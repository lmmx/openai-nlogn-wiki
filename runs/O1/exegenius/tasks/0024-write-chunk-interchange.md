# exegenius task 0024-write-chunk-interchange

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/O1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Fast address-chunk interchange
Gloss: A tape procedure that interchanges two disjoint u-bit address fields of an array in O(V u^τ) time for a fixed τ < 1, by running the bit network with shear frames and recursing on smaller interchanges.
Also called: chunk swap, address interchange

## This page in the argument

The step: Two disjoint $u$-bit address chunks of an array of volume $V$ can be interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time for a fixed $\tau<1$.
How: run the bit network on role streams with address-shear frames, implementing each edge by as many smaller interchanges as its rational rank, recurse on power widths, then remove width and row restrictions by padding
Why: Interchanging growing fields costs a full scan per digit; the network turns one interchange of width $mf$ into $s<Wm$ interchanges of width $f$ on streams of volume $V/W$, which gives a power saving. (the sources say so: "Because the sum of these ranks is less than the number of wires times" (paper))
Striking feature: The final effect is an exact data-independent permutation, yet it is computed by forming XOR combinations of the data. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Every rational $m\times m$ matrix of rank $a$ factors as $E_1\Pi E_2$ with invertible lower triangular $E_1,E_2$ and a partial permutation $\Pi$ with $a$ ones. (on [Lower triangular factorization](lower-triangular-factorization.md))
- The shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ needs exactly $a=\operatorname{rank}A$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ work. (on [Rational address shear](address-shear.md))
- For widths $e=m^k$ with enough rows, the interchange costs $O(Ve^\tau)$.
- Using high digits as rows, padding, a base-$m$ split of the width and padding binary chunks to radix $q$ gives $O(Vu^\tau)$ for every width $u$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of radix digits, move it by a Chinese-remainder map and Gaussian resampling to power-of-two axes, compute that convolution with synthetic polynomial transforms accelerated by two network-based tape procedures, recover the exact coefficients by rounding, and bound every cost term (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures save a power of their parameter: chunk interchange in $O(Vu^\tau)$ and a simultaneous butterfly layer in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with $\tau,\lambda'<1$.; how: derive both from fixed linear networks with a rank deficit, transferred to arrays by frames on role streams and applied recursively

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.3.3, S1.3.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.3.3**: For widths $e=m^k$ with enough rows, the interchange costs $O(Ve^\tau)$.
How: split rows into role streams, apply the bit network with frames $\Phi_{M_v}$ so that every role undergoes $H\gets H+D$, complete the interchange with two linear updates, and solve the resulting recurrence
- S1.3.3.2: Running the network with shear frames yields $H\gets H+D$ on every original row, including rows used as scratch.
  Source: "is $H\leftarrow H+D$ on every original row, including rows assigned" (paper)
  > The row split supplies the common address set used in the frame identity~\eqref{eq:common-frame-identity}. Here the frame at a vertex with matrix $M$ is the address permutation $\Phi_M$, and every edge changes it by $\Phi_{M'-M}$. The same invariant proof applies because a common address permutation commutes with every pointwise bit gate. For the physical input arrays $f_w$, the logical arrays are $g_w=\Phi_{-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}}f_w$; this only specifies their interpretation, with no initial tape operation. The logical circuit routes $g_w$ to role $\rho(w)$. Thus its physical output satisfies \[ f'_{\rho(w)} =\Phi_{M_{\mathrm{out}(\rho(w))}} \Phi_{-M_{\mathrm{in}(w)}}f_w =\Phi_{I_m}f_w, \] by~\eqref{eq:finite-shear-contract}. Merge by returning row $g$ of output role $\rho(w)$ to the original row $Wg+(w-1)$ within the same preceding prefix. This undoes $\rho$ and restores row order. The result is $H\leftarrow H+D$ on every original row, including rows assigned to scratch roles, whose initial values were arbitrary.
- S1.3.3.3: The updates $D\gets D-H$, $H\gets H+D$, $D\gets H-D$ send $(H,D)$ to $(D,H)$.
  Source: "sends $(H,D)$ to $(D,H)$." (paper)
  > To interchange the two full chunks, perform \[ D\leftarrow D-H,\qquad H\leftarrow H+D,\qquad D\leftarrow H-D, \] componentwise. Only the middle shear uses the circuit. The other two updates target the later group and have linear cost. The transformation sends $(H,D)$ to $(D,H)$.
- S1.3.3.4: The normalized cost satisfies $F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1)$, hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.
  Source: "Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$." (paper)
  > The number of recursive calls is the sum of the edge ranks, exactly $s$. Each acts on one role stream of volume $V/W$, retaining all other fields as spectators. Splitting, merging, gates, and triangular operations have total cost $O(V)$ because their number is fixed. Below we verify that scheduling the recursive calls on fixed tapes also costs $O(V)$ at this node. Thus if $F_k$ is a uniform upper bound for time divided by logical volume, then \begin{equation} \label{eq:swap-recurrence} F_0=O(1),\qquad F_k\le(s/W)F_{k-1}+O(1). \end{equation} For $a=s/W<m^\tau$ the geometric sum $\sum_{j=0}^k a^j$ is $O(m^{k\tau})$. If $a\le1$, the sum is at most $k+1=O(m^{k\tau})$; if $a>1$, it is $O(a^k)$. Hence $F_k=O(e^\tau)$.

**S1.3.4**: Using high digits as rows, padding, a base-$m$ split of the width and padding binary chunks to radix $q$ gives $O(Vu^\tau)$ for every width $u$.
Source: "Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is" (paper)
> Finally, for binary chunks let $e$ be the least integer with $q^e\ge2^u$. Pad each of the two chunk ranges numerically from $[2^u]$ to $[q^e]$, putting zero in an entry if either chunk coordinate is invalid. The increase in volume is less than $q^2$, a fixed factor. The padding is a nested scan through consecutive valid and invalid intervals, with their lengths prepared from the shape. It costs $O(V)$ with a constant depending on $q$. Lexicographic radix-$q$ order of $[q^e]$ is its numerical order, just as binary order of $[2^u]$ is its numerical order. Padding therefore preserves the order of the existing entries without converting the digits of every address. The completed interchange preserves the set on which both chunk coordinates lie below $2^u$. Scan away the other entries to recover the desired binary array. Since $e=O(u)$ for fixed $q$, the bound is $O(Vu^\tau)$. \end{proof}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S1.3.1 (on [Lower triangular factorization](lower-triangular-factorization.md)): Every rational $m\times m$ matrix of rank $a$ factors as $E_1\Pi E_2$ with invertible lower triangular $E_1,E_2$ and a partial permutation $\Pi$ with $a$ ones.
- S1.3.2 (on [Rational address shear](address-shear.md)): The shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ needs exactly $a=\operatorname{rank}A$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ work.
- S1.3.3.1 (on [Row splitting into role streams](role-streams.md)): Rows are distributed cyclically among the $W$ roles, so each role stream has the same shape and volume $V/W$.

### Other pages these steps use

Link each where the derivation uses it, stating what it gives; do not derive its results again.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Rational address shear](address-shear.md): The address permutation (H,D) ↦ (H+AD, D) on two groups of fields, performed with exactly rank(A) smaller field interchanges plus linear work.
  Shown as: Fast address-chunk interchange *<predicate>* Rational address shear
- [Frames and the common-frame identity](frames.md): Each network vertex gets an invertible linear operator (frame) giving the stored array's representation; since a common frame commutes with pointwise gates, the network implements the endpoint frame ratio on every role.
  Shown as: Fast address-chunk interchange *<predicate>* Frames and the common-frame identity
- [Rank deficit and recursive power saving](rank-deficit.md): The total number s of smaller calls satisfies s < Wm, so a recursion with parameter growth m and volume split W gives a cost factor e^τ with τ < 1 instead of e.
  Shown as: Fast address-chunk interchange *<predicate>* Rank deficit and recursive power saving
- [Row splitting into role streams](role-streams.md): Rows of an array are distributed cyclically among the network's W roles so each role stream has volume V/W, and recursive calls are scheduled depth-first on a fixed set of tapes by parking inactive streams on a stack.
  Shown as: Fast address-chunk interchange *<predicate>* Row splitting into role streams
- [Elementary stream operations](elementary-stream-ops.md): Linear-time tape primitives: permuting or moving single digits, splitting on a digit and merging, and splitting rows cyclically into a fixed number of streams.

## Pages that build on this one

- Packed selected-bit addition: XORing corresponding selected bits of two address chunks using eight cyclic shifts of whole chunks with guard values, then deterministically repairing the small set of exceptional addresses by sorting.
- Synthetic transform layout and cost: The tape layout that places the selected bits of all axes at common offsets in consecutive chunks, so each synthetic transform round is one simultaneous layer, with frequencies left in a retained bit-reversed order.
- Resampling with retained permutations: A variant of Gaussian resampling that keeps the source and target coordinate permutations inside the transform identity instead of executing them as sorts.
- Parameter choice and cost table: Fixed rational exponents (τ, λ′, ε, c, δ, …) and size parameters chosen so every row of the normalized cost table is at most p^{1−2κ}.
- Chinese-remainder address map: An algebra isomorphism from one cyclic convolution of length S = ∏ s_i to a multidimensional cyclic convolution on pairwise coprime axes, implemented by triangular controlled shifts and axis moves.
- Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time: One deterministic fixed-alphabet multitape Turing machine multiplies two n-bit integers exactly in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time with κ = 2^(−182), refuting the n log n optimality conjecture in that model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Its cost is $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$." (paper)

  > The first procedure interchanges two disjoint contiguous address fields of $u$ bits in an array whose addresses form a complete Cartesian product. Its cost is $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$. Although its final effect is an exact permutation, its intermediate steps form pointwise XOR combinations of data. The final permutation is exact for arbitrary initial auxiliary values.

- "Arbitrary-width interchange" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Arbitrary-width interchange] \label{lem:chunk-swap} There exist fixed $0<\tau<1$ and one fixed finite-alphabet multitape procedure with the following property. For positive integers $P,G,B$ and $u\ge1$, it transforms an arbitrary bit array on \[ [P]\times[2^u]\times[G]\times[2^u]\times[B] \] by the address permutation \[ (p,h,g,d,z)\longmapsto(p,d,g,h,z) \] in $O(Vu^\tau)$ steps, where $V=PG B\,2^{2u}$. The integers specifying the shape are part of the input. The time includes their processing, all padding and unpadding, and fixed-tape workspace cleanup. In particular, $B=1$ is allowed. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-chunk-interchange.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-chunk-interchange.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0024-write-chunk-interchange` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0024-write-chunk-interchange`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
