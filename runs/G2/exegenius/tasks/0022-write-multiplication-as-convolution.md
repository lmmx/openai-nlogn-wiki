# exegenius task 0022-write-multiplication-as-convolution

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: Undergraduate computer science: algorithms and complexity through big-O analysis, recurrences and divide-and-conquer (Karatsuba, FFT-based polynomial multiplication, usually met at the level of the standard recursive FFT), discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes and gcd, sets, functions and permutations, induction), and introductory linear algebra (matrices, rank, bases, inner products, Gaussian elimination, over the reals and probably F_2).

## This page

Concept: Multiplication as convolution of radix digits
Gloss: Splitting both integers into radix-2^b digits makes the product a convolution of the digit coefficient lists, followed by carry propagation.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The procedure that extracts radix-$2^b$ digits, applies the Chinese-remainder address map $\Phi$, computes two forward source transforms, a pointwise product and the opposite transform with exact rescalings, rounds, and propagates carries outputs the exact $2n$-bit product. (on [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md))
- Writing the inputs as polynomials in $2^b$ with $\lceil n/b\rceil$ digits, the product has degree below $S$, so convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no wraparound and every product coefficient is below $2^{3b}$.
- With $P_i=\prod_{j<i}s_j$ and $\mu_i=P_i^{-1}\bmod s_i$, the map $\Phi:x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$ is an algebra isomorphism from $\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)$ to $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_d]/(x_i^{s_i}-1)$ that turns cyclic convolution of length $S$ into convolution on the product of cyclic axes, and it and its inverse are implemented by triangular controlled shifts in time $O(T p\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$. (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-address-map.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Cyclic convolution](cyclic-convolution.md): The product of two coefficient arrays indexed by ℤ/tℤ (or a product of such groups) as in multiplication of polynomials modulo x^t−1; the Fourier transform turns it into pointwise multiplication.
  Shown as: Multiplication as convolution of radix digits *<predicate>* Cyclic convolution

## Pages that build on this one

- Error bounds and exact recovery: Contraction-based accumulation of approximation errors through all steps, removal of known normalizations and scales, showing the coefficient error is below 1/2 so rounding gives exact integers.
- The established O(N log N) multiplier: The Harvey–van der Hoeven fixed-tape multiplier with cost O(N log 2N) on N-bit inputs, used only as an ordinary subroutine on short inputs.
- The multiplication algorithm: Digit extraction, the Chinese-remainder map, two forward source transforms, pointwise product, opposite transform, rescaling, rounding and carry propagation yielding the exact 2n-bit product.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

- "Propagate radix-$2^b$ carries in increasing coefficient order." (paper)

  > exactly by $S$, retaining the denominator $2^p$ and writing each component in signed width $w_{\rm c}+b$. Denote the represented dyadic array by $\widetilde w$. \item Multiply the grid numerators of $\widetilde w$ exactly by $2^{2b+4}S$, again retaining the denominator $2^p$, and write each component in signed width $w_{\rm c}+4b+4$. Round the represented real values to the nearest integers. At each valid address, write the rounded coefficient in one signed $(3b+1)$-bit word, most significant bit first; at every padded address, write a zero word of that width. Supply this local payload width to $\Phi^{-1}$ and apply it, including removal of the address padding, to restore the ordinary coefficient order. \item Propagate radix-$2^b$ carries in increasing coefficient order. Write the resulting bits from least to most significant on a work tape, then reverse that stream and output exactly $2n$ bits in most-significant-first order. \end{enumerate}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-multiplication-as-convolution.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-multiplication-as-convolution.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0022-write-multiplication-as-convolution` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0022-write-multiplication-as-convolution`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
