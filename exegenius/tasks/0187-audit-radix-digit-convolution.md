# exegenius task 0187-audit-radix-digit-convolution

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Radix-digit convolution

Radix-digit convolution is a reduction of [exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md) that writes each input as a polynomial in a power of two whose coefficients are its digits, so that the product becomes a convolution of short integer coefficients. It is the first step of the argument for [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md): the [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md) and [carry propagation](carry-propagation.md) pages build on the coefficients it produces.

The paper states the reduction in one sentence:

**Digits.** Let $x$ and $y$ be the two binary strings, each of $n$ bits. Fix a digit width $b \ge 1$. The digit width is the number of bits in each digit. Cut each input into blocks of $b$ bits, counting from the least significant end and padding the last block with leading zeros. Each block is a digit in base $2^b$, the radix. Let $m = \lceil n/b \rceil$ be the number of digits in each input.

The paper takes, so that $2^b \ge n$.

Let $i$ be the position of a digit, running from $0$ to $m-1$. Let $x_i$ be the digit of $x$ at position $i$, with weight $(2^b)^i$, so that $x = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x_i (2^b)^i$. The digits $y_i$ of $y$ are defined the same way.

**Polynomials.** Let $z$ be a formal variable. Write $X(z) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x_i z^i$ and $Y(z) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} y_i z^i$. Substituting $z = 2^b$ returns the inputs: $X(2^b) = x$ and $Y(2^b) = y$.

Let $t$ be the position of a product coefficient, running from $0$ to $2m-2$. Let $c_t$ be the integer coefficient of $z^t$ in the product $X(z)Y(z)$. Then
$$c_t = \sum_i x_i\, y_{t-i},$$
summed over the $i$ with $0 \le i \le m-1$ and $0 \le t-i \le m-1$. This sum is the convolution of the digit sequences $(x_i)$ and $(y_i)$. Substituting $z = 2^b$ gives $xy = \sum_t c_t (2^b)^t$, so the product is recovered from the $c_t$. The $c_t$ are not yet binary digits, since a coefficient can exceed $2^b-1$.

**Coefficient size.** Each $c_t$ is a sum of at most $m$ products $x_i y_{t-i}$, and each product is at most $(2^b-1)^2$. So $0 \le c_t \le m(2^b-1)^2$. this bound, and it gives $c_t < 2^{3b}$. Because $b \ge 1$ and $n$ is an integer, $m = \lceil n/b \rceil \le n \le 2^b$. Hence $c_t \le 2^b \cdot (2^b)^2 = 2^{3b}$, and the strict inequality holds because $(2^b-1)^2 < 2^{2b}$. Each coefficient therefore fits in $3b$ bits. Since $b = \lceil \log_2 n \rceil < \log_2 n + 1$, each coefficient has $O(\log n)$ bits.

**Example.** Take $n = 4$. Then $b = 2$ and $m = 2$. Let $x = 1101$ (value 13) and $y = 1011$ (value 11). Splitting into base-4 digits from the least significant end gives $x_0 = 1$, $x_1 = 3$, $y_0 = 3$ and $y_1 = 2$. The coefficients are $c_0 = x_0 y_0 = 3$, $c_1 = x_0 y_1 + x_1 y_0 = 2 + 9 = 11$ and $c_2 = x_1 y_1 = 6$. Check: $3 + 11 \cdot 4 + 6 \cdot 16 = 143 = 13 \cdot 11$. The coefficient $c_1 = 11$ is larger than a digit, so the sequence is not yet the binary product. [Carry propagation](carry-propagation.md) converts it into one.

**Why the split lowers cost.** Arithmetic on one coefficient is cheap, since it works on $O(\log n)$-bit numbers. The cost lies in moving data. The $2m-1$ coefficients occupy $(2m-1) \cdot 3b$ stored bits. Since $m \ge n/b$ and $m \le n/b + 1$, this is between $6n - 3b$ and $6n + 3b$ bits, which is $\Theta(n)$ because $b = O(\log n)$.

The convolution is computed with [Fourier transforms](discrete-fourier-transform.md). A transform proceeds in transform levels, where each level is one pass of address rearrangements and butterfly operations over the whole array. On a tape, a pass reads the array in order and writes each entry back at its new address, so one level costs time proportional to the stored bits. Each level therefore scans all $\Theta(n)$ stored bits, even though each coefficient is small. The paper's count of this cost is that
