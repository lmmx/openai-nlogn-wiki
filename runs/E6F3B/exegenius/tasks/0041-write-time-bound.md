Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F3B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Complete time bound
Gloss: Dividing costs by the volume Tp, seven dominant terms with powers of p below one (margins g₁,…,g₇) show total time O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}); the smallest margin is 2κ.

## This page in the argument

The step: Dividing costs by the volume $Tp$, seven dominant terms with powers of $p$ below one, with margins $g_1,\dots,g_7$ all at least $2\kappa$, give total time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.
How: Tabulate the normalized cost of every phase, bound each by a power of $p$ below one, and read off the exponent from the smallest margin.
Why: Costs are listed divided by the stored volume so that each phase can be compared with $p^{1}$. (the sources say so: "$\Theta(V)$ stored bits. Table~\ref{tab:costs} lists costs after division" (paper))
Striking feature: The smallest margin is $2^{-181}=2\kappa$, so $\kappa=2^{-182}$ is exactly half of it; it equals $\epsilon c(1-\tau)$, the product of the dimension exponent, the chunk-width exponent and the interchange saving. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Direct substitution of the fixed exponents gives margins $g_1>1/2$, $g_2=2^{-181}$, $g_3=2^{-129}$, $g_4>2^{-51}$, $g_5>1/8$, $g_6>1/2$, $g_7=2^{-75}$.
- Thus the smallest margin is $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
- The first three rows are the terms of the synthetic transform cost, from $O(dK)$ scans, $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges and at most $\ell$ simultaneous rounds.
- Axis exposure and restoration take $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves, each $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$, giving the CRT and axis-layout row.
- The Gaussian line maps cost $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$, which is $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$ after dividing by $Tp$.
- Chirps, twists and scalar products cost $O(dp^{1+\delta})$ per entry, and the packed polynomial products cost $O(Tp\log(rp))$.
- Setup at recursion nodes, per-record and per-line descriptor work, and the compact exceptional streams cost $o(Tp)$, since $r$ exceeds every fixed power of $p$ and the bad fraction is $2^{-K}$.
- Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually.
- The complete large-input bound is therefore $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$, and schoolbook multiplication below a fixed cutoff covers the finitely many smaller lengths.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Build two fast tape procedures, a bit-chunk interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, use them to evaluate the transforms of a digit convolution on an array of ring records, assemble the exact multiplier, and total its cost.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S7.1, S7.2, S7.3, S7.4, S7.5, S7.6, S7.7, S7.8, S7.9). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S7.1**: Direct substitution of the fixed exponents gives margins $g_1>1/2$, $g_2=2^{-181}$, $g_3=2^{-129}$, $g_4>2^{-51}$, $g_5>1/8$, $g_6>1/2$, $g_7=2^{-75}$.
Source: "g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad" (paper)
> The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

**S7.2**: Thus the smallest margin is $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
Source: "Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$." (paper)
> The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

**S7.3**: The first three rows are the terms of the synthetic transform cost, from $O(dK)$ scans, $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges and at most $\ell$ simultaneous rounds.
Source: "The first three rows are the terms in" (paper)
> Here $d^2$ is absorbed by $d^2\ell^\tau$, and $\log(rp)=O(p^{1-\epsilon}+\log p)=O(p^{1-\epsilon})$. The first three rows are the terms in \eqref{eq:synthetic-transform-cost}. The prefix-slot moves and individual butterfly rounds in Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost} use $O(dK)$ linear scans. Its positional layout uses $O(p/K)$ exchanges of width-$K$ chunks, because $d\ell=O(p)$. Each exchange costs $O(VK^\tau)$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chunk-swap}, so the normalized total is \[ O(p/K)\,K^\tau=O(pK^{\tau-1}). \] For the at most $\ell$ simultaneous rounds, Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer} supplies $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ per round. Its bound already includes the binary basis changes, deterministic repair, row padding and removal, all base-$m$ groups, and fixed-tape cleanup.

**S7.4**: Axis exposure and restoration take $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves, each $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$, giving the CRT and axis-layout row.
Source: "Axis exposure and restoration require $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves." (paper)
> Axis exposure and restoration require $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves. Each costs $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$: peel a single excess bit when widths differ by one, exchange their equal-width parts, and restore the bit. The $d$ CRT rotations copy valid and invalid intervals in $O(dV)$ time. Their offset setup was bounded above by $O(dTp^C/r)=o(Tp)$, using at most $T/t_i$ control prefixes for target $i$.

**S7.5**: The Gaussian line maps cost $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$, which is $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$ after dividing by $Tp$.
Source: "For Gaussian resampling, axis $i$ has at most $T/t_i$ processed lines." (paper)
> For Gaussian resampling, axis $i$ has at most $T/t_i$ processed lines. The line-machine costs therefore sum to \[ \sum_{i=1}^d\frac{T}{t_i} O(t_i p^{3/2+\delta}\alpha) =O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha). \] Dividing by $V=Tp$ gives the fifth row. The factor $\alpha=\Theta(p^{1/4+\epsilon/2})$ explains its displayed power of $p$.

**S7.6**: Chirps, twists and scalar products cost $O(dp^{1+\delta})$ per entry, and the packed polynomial products cost $O(Tp\log(rp))$.
Source: "Chirp numerators have $O(p)$ bits and can be computed modulo $2r$ as" (paper)
> Chirp numerators have $O(p)$ bits and can be computed modulo $2r$ as sums of $d$ terms $s_i j_i^2(r/t_i)$. Computing their squares and products with the previously established $O(N\log(2N))$ multiplier on $N$-bit inputs, then generating the exponentials, costs $O(dp^{1+\delta})$ per entry. The smaller twist and scalar pointwise-product costs fit the same row: they use a fixed number of exact products on $O(p)$-bit component numerators, followed by linear truncation scans. The two final products by $S$ also cost $O(p\log p)$ per entry, so their normalized cost is $O(\log p)=O(p^\delta)$ as listed separately. There are $T/r$ polynomial records in each pointwise ring product. Four integer products on $O(rp)$ bits per record therefore cost $O(Tp\log(rp))$ in total. Signed packing, centered extraction, negacyclic wrapping, and copying are linear stream passes. These calls use the previously established multiplier on records of length $O(rp)=o(n)$; they do not call the improved algorithm being constructed. The exact source scaling by $2^\gamma$ is a shift of $O(p)$-bit numerators by $\gamma=O(p)$ places, so it is a linear scan per entry and fits the final-scaling row. The scalar-format adapters and the exact removal of sign-extension bits after the ring and source scales also use linear scans of their $O(p)$-bit components, within the listed scan costs.

**S7.7**: Setup at recursion nodes, per-record and per-line descriptor work, and the compact exceptional streams cost $o(Tp)$, since $r$ exceeds every fixed power of $p$ and the bad fraction is $2^{-K}$.
Source: "costs at most $p^{A+C}=o(Tp)$." (paper)
> \paragraph{Setup and exceptional streams across all calls.} We next separate setup at recursion nodes from work repeated for every polynomial record or every Gaussian line. Here a visit means a node of the layer or address-layout recursions, or one of their round and group invocations. The internal recursion of the established integer multiplier and the iterations of the quoted Gaussian algorithms are already included in their separately charged running times. The layer and address-layout recursions have constant branching and depth $O(\log p)$, and the number of their rounds and base-$m$ groups is polynomial in $p$. Choose a fixed exponent $A$ so that their total number of visits is at most $p^A$, and a fixed $C$ bounding descriptor setup performed once per visit by $p^C$ steps. This setup then costs at most $p^{A+C}=o(Tp)$.

**S7.8**: Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually.
Source: "Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by" (paper)
> Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by \eqref{eq:margin-list}. Any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually. The complete large-input bound is consequently \[ O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}). \] Fix one cutoff beyond all the size, precision, margin and layout conditions, and use schoolbook multiplication below it. The finitely many smaller lengths are included by enlarging the implicit constant. With $\lg n=\max\{\lceil\log_2n\rceil,1\}$, the resulting single fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape deterministic machine has worst-case time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every input length and produces precisely the required $2n$-bit product. \section{Exact division and integer square root} \label{sec:exact-arithmetic-proof}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0041-write-time-bound.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0041-write-time-bound.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0041-write-time-bound` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0041-write-time-bound`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
