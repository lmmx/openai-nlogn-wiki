Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F8B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: algorithm analysis with big-O, divide and conquer and sorting, discrete mathematics (sets, permutations, modular arithmetic, primes, induction), and introductory linear algebra (matrices, linear maps, invertibility, triangular and permutation matrices).

## This page

Concept: Synthetic polynomial transform
Gloss: A Fourier-type transform over the negacyclic ring whose roots of unity ω_t=y^{2r/t} are signed coefficient shifts, so each twiddle multiplication is free of real arithmetic.

## This page in the argument

The step: In $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ the powers of $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$ are signed shifts, so the transforms $F_t^\pm$ are contractions and satisfy $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce the product to a convolution of radix digits evaluated by approximate Fourier transforms over a polynomial ring, make the transform's address movement and arithmetic cheaper with two new tape procedures, then show the result is exact and add up the cost. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- The forward synthetic transform of $d-1$ axes over $\mathcal R_r$ and its opposite run in $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$ time with error below $\sqrt2\,\ell\,2^{-p}$, and the forward outputs are kept in a retained layout order.; how: Define the transform by radix-two butterflies with signed-shift twiddles, track where each output lands, and arrange the bits on tape so that each round is one simultaneous butterfly layer. (on [Transform layout on tape](transform-tape-layout.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1](negacyclic-ring.md): Complex polynomials of degree less than r with y^r=−1, in which powers of y are roots of unity and multiplication by y^a is a signed shift of the coefficient list.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transform *<predicate>* Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1
- [Fast Fourier transform with butterflies](fft-butterflies.md): Computing a length-2^a transform in a levels, each pairing entries by a two-point butterfly H₀(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u−v)/2) followed by a twiddle multiplication.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transform *<predicate>* Fast Fourier transform with butterflies
- [Discrete Fourier transform](discrete-fourier-transform.md): The normalized transform F_q that averages inputs weighted by roots of unity; it turns convolution into pointwise multiplication.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transform *<predicate>* Discrete Fourier transform

## Pages that build on this one

- Retained frequency order: The forward transform writes outputs in bit-reversed order; the pointwise product and the opposite transform both use this order, so no permutation is ever executed.
- Transform layout on tape: Placing the selected bit of each participating axis at a common offset in consecutive K-bit chunks, using bit moves and chunk interchanges, so that each transform round is one simultaneous butterfly layer.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "For a power of two $t$ dividing $2r$, define $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$." (paper)

  > For a power of two $t$ dividing $2r$, define $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$. For $z\in\mathcal R_r^t$ and $0\leq j<t$, set \[ (F_t^-z)_j=\frac1t\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{-jk}z_k, \qquad (F_t^+z)_j=\frac1t\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{jk}z_k. \] Every power of $\omega_t$ is an isometry, and each transform entry is an average of $t$ such images. Thus both transforms are contractions. The ring has zero divisors, so we verify character cancellation directly instead of dividing by $\omega_t^j-1$.

- "multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0025-write-synthetic-polynomial-transform.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0025-write-synthetic-polynomial-transform.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0025-write-synthetic-polynomial-transform` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0025-write-synthetic-polynomial-transform`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
