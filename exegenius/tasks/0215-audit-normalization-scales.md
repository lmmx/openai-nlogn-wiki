# exegenius task 0215-audit-normalization-scales

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Normalization scales

Normalization scales are the known powers of two and transform lengths by which a computed product is multiplied at the end, so that the result is the exact integer convolution rather than a scaled copy of it. The integer multiplication argument uses them as its last arithmetic step before rounding and carry propagation: [Bluestein's chirp identity](bluestein-chirp-identity.md) turns the middle transform into a [normalized cyclic convolution](normalized-cyclic-convolution.md), and the scales then remove the factors that the transforms and the digit encoding introduced.

The normalized transform $F_q$ of length $q$ averages its inputs: by complex numbers of modulus one. Its inverse $F_q^+$ is the transform with the opposite sign, and $I$ denotes the identity map. The source writes the transform length as the letter S; here it is $q$, as in the [discrete Fourier transform](discrete-fourier-transform.md). Two rules hold for inputs $u$ and $v$ of length $q$: Read with $q$ for the length, these say $F_q(u \ast v) = q\,(F_q u)\cdot(F_q v)$ and $F_q^+F_q = \frac{1}{q}I$.

Normalization scales undo the normalization of [normalized cyclic convolution](normalized-cyclic-convolution.md): the transforms compute the convolution divided by a power of $q$, and the scales multiply that power back in.

Applying the convolution rule to the transformed inputs and then the inverse gives
$$
F_q^+\big((F_q u)\cdot(F_q v)\big) = \frac{1}{q}\,F_q^+F_q(u \ast v) = \frac{1}{q^2}\,(u \ast v).
$$
So three normalized transforms leave the exact convolution divided by $q^2$. The two normalizations are different, which is why there are two multiplications. The first multiplication by $q$ gives $(u \ast v)/q$. The second multiplication by $q$ gives $u \ast v$.

Worked example: take $q = 4$ and suppose the transforms leave the coefficient $3/16$, whose exact value is $3/16 \cdot 16 = 3$. Multiplying by $q$ gives $3/4$, and multiplying by $q$ again gives $3$.

The digits carry a second scale. Write $\sigma = 2^{-b-2}$ for the digit scale: each radix-$2^b$ digit $a_j$ is stored as the number $\sigma a_j$. For a stored value $a/2^p$ with $a$ an integer, $a$ is its grid numerator. The stored digit has grid numerator $a_j 2^{p-b-2}$, and. A product of two such digit arrays therefore carries the factor $\sigma^2 = 2^{-2b-4}$, and The factor $2^{2b+4}$ removes it.

Worked example: take $b = 2$, so $\sigma = 2^{-4}$. The digit $a = 3$ is stored as $3/16$, and the product of the digits $3$ and $2$ is stored as $6/256$. Multiplying by $2^{2b+4} = 256$ returns $6$.

Together, the algorithm multiplies by $q$ once, then by $2^{2b+4} q$, and the result is $2^{2b+4}(u \ast v)$, the integer coefficient convolution of the digit arrays. Both scales act on grid numerators with no rounding: Because the scales introduce no rounding, the only error left is in the transforms, and it is bounded separately: the same section so rounding to the nearest integer recovers each coefficient.
