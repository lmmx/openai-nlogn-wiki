# exegenius task 0385-write-cost-accounting

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Cost accounting and the exponent κ
Gloss: Dividing each cost by V = Tp, the dominant terms are powers of p below one with minimum margin 2^{-181} = 2κ, giving total time O(n(lg n)^{1−κ}).

## This page in the argument

The step: The total time of the machine is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$: after dividing each cost by $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$ the dominant terms are powers of $p$ below one, with minimum margin $2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
How: Divide each cost by the volume, list the dominant terms with their powers of $p$, compute their margins below one from the fixed rational parameters, justify each row from the lemmas, show setup is negligible, and add.
Why: Taking the margin to be twice $\kappa$ leaves room for any remaining fixed power of $\log p$. (the sources say so: "This explicit slack will cover" (paper))
Striking feature: The final exponent is only $2^{-182}$ below one: it is set by the least of seven margins, the chunk-exchange row $g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau)=2^{-181}$. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Dividing each cost by $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$, seven operations dominate, each a power of $p$ with exponent $1-g_i$ for a margin $g_i>0$ listed row by row.
- The seven margins are $g_1>1/2$, $g_2=2^{-181}$, $g_3=2^{-129}$, $g_4>2^{-51}$, $g_5>1/8$, $g_6>1/2$, $g_7=2^{-75}$, so the minimum is $2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
- Each of the seven normalized costs is justified from the lemmas: the layout exchanges cost $O(pK^{\tau-1})$, axis moves $O(d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$, Gaussian lines $O(dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha)$, chirps $O(dp^{1+\delta})$ per entry, and polynomial products $O(Tp\log(rp))$ in total.
- Setup at recursion nodes, exceptional-address repair, global setup and prime search together cost $o(V)$.
- Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, so the total is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$, and with schoolbook multiplication below a fixed cutoff the single machine runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every $n\ge1$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic Turing machine with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture of Sch\"onhage and Strassen in this model.; how: Build two power-saving tape procedures (chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layer) from fixed finite linear networks; use them to accelerate the synthetic polynomial transforms and ring convolution; use Gaussian resampling with retained permutations and chirps to reduce the prime-length cyclic convolution of the radix-digit coefficients to those power-of-two transforms; assemble the exact product with a proof that the error is below $1/2$; and total the cost to show a power of $\log n$ is saved.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S6.1, S6.2, S6.3, S6.4, S6.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S6.1**: Dividing each cost by $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$, seven operations dominate, each a power of $p$ with exponent $1-g_i$ for a margin $g_i>0$ listed row by row.
How: Tabulate the normalized cost of each operation of the algorithm and read off its power of $p$ from the sizes $d=\Theta(p^\epsilon)$, $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$, $\ell=\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})$, $\alpha=\Theta(p^{1/4+\epsilon/2})$; the last two rows (final scaling, input and output) are absorbed.
- S6.1.1: Prefix-slot moves and individual butterfly rounds cost $dK$ per unit volume, a power $p^{\epsilon(1+c)}$ since $d=\Theta(p^\epsilon)$ and $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$; margin $g_1=1-\epsilon(1+c)>1/2$.

**S6.2**: The seven margins are $g_1>1/2$, $g_2=2^{-181}$, $g_3=2^{-129}$, $g_4>2^{-51}$, $g_5>1/8$, $g_6>1/2$, $g_7=2^{-75}$, so the minimum is $2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
How: Substitute the fixed rational parameters $\epsilon=2^{-75}$, $c=2^{-56}$, $1-\tau=2^{-50}$, $1-\lambda'=2^{-54}$, $\delta=1/16$ into the seven margin expressions.
- S6.2.1: Direct substitution gives $g_1>1/2$, $g_2=2^{-181}$, $g_3=2^{-129}$.
  Source: "g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad" (paper)
  > The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.
- S6.2.2: Likewise $g_4>2^{-51}$, $g_5>1/8$, $g_6>1/2$, $g_7=2^{-75}$.

This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.
- S6.2.3: Thus $\min_ig_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$, explicit slack that covers any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.
  Source: "Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.  This explicit slack will cover" (paper)

This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

**S6.3**: Each of the seven normalized costs is justified from the lemmas: the layout exchanges cost $O(pK^{\tau-1})$, axis moves $O(d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$, Gaussian lines $O(dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha)$, chirps $O(dp^{1+\delta})$ per entry, and polynomial products $O(Tp\log(rp))$ in total.
How: Combine the costs of the lemmas: $O(p/K)$ exchanges each costing $O(VK^\tau)$, $O(d^2)$ axis moves each $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$, at most $T/t_i$ lines per axis, per-entry chirp arithmetic, and $T/r$ ring products of $O(rp)$ bits each.

  > Here $d^2$ is absorbed by $d^2\ell^\tau$, and $\log(rp)=O(p^{1-\epsilon}+\log p)=O(p^{1-\epsilon})$. The first three rows are the terms in \eqref{eq:synthetic-transform-cost}. The prefix-slot moves and individual butterfly rounds in Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost} use $O(dK)$ linear scans. Its positional layout uses $O(p/K)$ exchanges of width-$K$ chunks, because $d\ell=O(p)$. Each exchange costs $O(VK^\tau)$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:chunk-swap}, so the normalized total is \[ O(p/K)\,K^\tau=O(pK^{\tau-1}). \] For the at most $\ell$ simultaneous rounds, Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer} supplies $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ per round. Its bound already includes the binary basis changes, deterministic repair, row padding and removal, all base-$m$ groups, and fixed-tape cleanup.

- S6.3.3: Axis exposure and restoration take $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves, each costing $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$ by peeling a single excess bit when widths differ by one, exchanging the equal-width parts and restoring the bit.
  Source: "Each costs $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$: peel a single excess bit when widths" (paper)
  > Axis exposure and restoration require $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves. Each costs $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$: peel a single excess bit when widths differ by one, exchange their equal-width parts, and restore the bit. The $d$ CRT rotations copy valid and invalid intervals in $O(dV)$ time. Their offset setup was bounded above by $O(dTp^C/r)=o(Tp)$, using at most $T/t_i$ control prefixes for target $i$.
- S6.3.4: Axis $i$ has at most $T/t_i$ processed lines, so Gaussian line-machine costs sum to $\sum_iT/t_i\cdot O(t_ip^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)=O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$.

The factor $\alpha=\Theta(p^{1/4+\epsilon/2})$ explains its displayed power of $p$.

  > Chirp numerators have $O(p)$ bits and can be computed modulo $2r$ as sums of $d$ terms $s_i j_i^2(r/t_i)$. Computing their squares and products with the previously established $O(N\log(2N))$ multiplier on $N$-bit inputs, then generating the exponentials, costs $O(dp^{1+\delta})$ per entry. The smaller twist and scalar pointwise-product costs fit the same row: they use a fixed number of exact products on $O(p)$-bit component numerators, followed by linear truncation scans. The two final products by $S$ also cost $O(p\log p)$ per entry, so their normalized cost is $O(\log p)=O(p^\delta)$ as listed separately. There are $T/r$ polynomial records in each pointwise ring product. Four integer products on $O(rp)$ bits per record therefore cost $O(Tp\log(rp))$ in total. Signed packing, centered extraction, negacyclic wrapping, and copying are linear stream passes. These calls use the previously established multiplier on records of length $O(rp)=o(n)$; they do not call the improved algorithm being constructed. The exact source scaling by $2^\gamma$ is a shift of $O(p)$-bit numerators by $\gamma=O(p)$ places, so it is a linear scan per entry and fits the final-scaling row. The scalar-format adapters and the exact removal of sign-extension bits after the ring and source scales also use linear scans of their $O(p)$-bit components, within the listed scan costs.

**S6.4**: Setup at recursion nodes, exceptional-address repair, global setup and prime search together cost $o(V)$.
How: Separate per-visit setup from per-record work: the recursions have constant branching and depth $O(\log p)$ with polynomially many visits ($\le p^A$ visits each of cost $p^C$), per-record or per-line polynomial work is $o(Tp)$ because $r$ exceeds every power of $p$, and exceptional streams are a fraction $O(d2^{-K})$ of the volume.
- S6.4.1: Total setup over at most $p^A$ visits each costing $p^C$ is at most $p^{A+C}=o(Tp)$.
  Source: "costs at most $p^{A+C}=o(Tp)$." (paper)
  > \paragraph{Setup and exceptional streams across all calls.} We next separate setup at recursion nodes from work repeated for every polynomial record or every Gaussian line. Here a visit means a node of the layer or address-layout recursions, or one of their round and group invocations. The internal recursion of the established integer multiplier and the iterations of the quoted Gaussian algorithms are already included in their separately charged running times. The layer and address-layout recursions have constant branching and depth $O(\log p)$, and the number of their rounds and base-$m$ groups is polynomial in $p$. Choose a fixed exponent $A$ so that their total number of visits is at most $p^A$, and a fixed $C$ bounding descriptor setup performed once per visit by $p^C$ steps. This setup then costs at most $p^{A+C}=o(Tp)$.
- S6.4.2: The compact exceptional stream of a packed change of basis has length $O\left(\frac{V_{\rm call}}{rp}d2^{-K}(rp+p)\right)=O(V_{\rm call}d2^{-K})$.
  Source: "O\!\left(\frac{V_{\rm call}}{rp}\,d2^{-K}(rp+p)\right)" (paper)
  > For one packed change of basis, let $V_{\rm call}$ be its current logical volume. The bad-address fraction is $O(d2^{-K})$, independently of the payload. Each polynomial record has $\Theta(rp)$ payload bits, and an exceptional record adds an $O(p)$-bit destination key. Thus the compact exceptional stream has length \[ O\!\left(\frac{V_{\rm call}}{rp}\,d2^{-K}(rp+p)\right) =O(V_{\rm call}d2^{-K}). \] Stable bit sorting makes $O(p)$ scans of this stream, for one-call cost $O(V_{\rm call}dp2^{-K})$. Extraction and reinsertion use a constant number of scans of the full current volume; those scans are already in the node overhead. Since there are at most $p^A$ visits, each of volume $O(V)$, the compact sorting costs sum to at most \[ O\!\left(dp2^{-K}\sum_{\rm calls}V_{\rm call}\right) =O(Vp^{A'}2^{-K})=o(V) \] for another fixed exponent $A'$. Here $d=O(p^\epsilon)$ and $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$ with $\epsilon c>0$. Predicate and key arithmetic is the polynomial work per record counted above. This is a deterministic worst-case bound.
- S6.4.3: Stable bit sorting makes $O(p)$ scans of it; summed over the visits the compact sorting costs $O(Vp^{A'}2^{-K})=o(V)$ since $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$ with $\epsilon c>0$ (a deterministic worst-case bound).

**S6.5**: Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, so the total is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$, and with schoolbook multiplication below a fixed cutoff the single machine runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every $n\ge1$.
How: Combine the margin bound $\min g_i=2\kappa$ with the absorption of logarithmic factors into one margin $\kappa$, and absorb finitely many small lengths into the constant.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$." (paper)

  > The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Why does kappa equal 2^-182 and not some larger constant? Which part of the cost accounting fixes it, and why is the margin taken to be twice kappa?" got stuck at "any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually": I could not tell which factors in the cost are the fixed powers of log p. The seven dominant terms are all written as powers of p (the log(rp) product term is converted to p^(1-epsilon)), and no page I opened lists the leftover log factors. The step from the powers to the factor p^kappa, which is what forces the margin to be 2 kappa and not kappa, therefore rests on an unidentified factor. (stuck at the step level)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Why does kappa equal 2^-182 and not some larger constant? Which part of the cost accounting fixes it, and why is the margin taken to be twice kappa?" got stuck at "Schoolbook multiplication below a fixed cutoff is absorbed One machine thus runs in": This sentence is garbled: it has no full stop, and it joins the small-n case to the claim for every n >= 1 without a clear step. I could not tell whether it is a claim or a remark, and so could not tell whether the bound is established for all n or only for large n. (stuck at the statement level)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Gaussian resampling is used so that Fourier transforms of prime length can be done with power-of-two transforms. Why does the algorithm leave the coordinate permutations inside the transform identities instead of executing them, and why do the source permutation and the target permutation both disappear without any sorting?" got stuck at "The layout needs $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges": The cost accounting lists chunk exchanges and prefix moves as the dominant costs, but does not say which of them come from the source or target permutations, so I could not connect the cost argument to the question of why the permutations are not executed. (stuck at the beyond level)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Why can the log n factor in n log n only be beaten here by making address movement and butterfly arithmetic cheaper, rather than by some other tweak of a standard FFT-style multiplier? What accounting of a standard transform on a tape machine leads to this?" got stuck at "The exponent is only $2^{-182}$ below one because $g_2$ multiplies three small numbers": I could follow the product 2^-75 times 2^-56 times 2^-50, but not why the chunk-exchange term, rather than the others, is the one that sets the saving. That link is what the question needs between address movement and the result. (the reader followed the steps but not why they lead where they do: say what this step is for)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Why does kappa equal 2^-182 and not some larger constant? Which part of the cost accounting fixes it, and why is the margin taken to be twice kappa?" got stuck at "The layout needs $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges, as $d\ell=O(p)$, each costing $O(VK^\tau)$ by [Fast address-chunk interchange](pid).": I could not see why there are p/K exchanges. The Chinese-remainder address map page counts O(d^2) adjacent axis moves, each of cost O(V l^tau), and gives no p/K count. I guessed that the d*l = O(p) address bits are cut into width-K chunks. This is the step that gives the exponent 1-eps*c*(1-tau). (stuck at the step level)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Why does kappa equal 2^-182 and not some larger constant? Which part of the cost accounting fixes it, and why is the margin taken to be twice kappa?" got stuck at "which the margin $2\kappa$ leaves room for.": The pages do not say why the margin is 2*kappa and not some other multiple. By my own asymptotic reasoning, p^(1-g_2) times a power of log p is at most p^(1-kappa) for any kappa below g_2, so the factor of two looks like a convention. I got past this by reasoning, not from the pages. (the reader followed the steps but not why they lead where they do: say what this step is for)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Summarise in a few sentences what the main theorem says about multiplying two n-bit integers, in which machine model it holds, which earlier conjecture it refutes, and the overall plan the proof follows to get there." got stuck at "Packed selected-bit addition, where the packed shifts of [Packed selected-bit addition](guz) fail, are bounded to a fraction $O(d2^{-K})$ of addresses.": Packed selected-bit addition is an invented name used both for a procedure and for a bad set of addresses, and I did not decode what the packed shifts are. I accepted the small-fraction bound and so the repair cost. (stuck at the symbol level)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Summarise in a few sentences what the main theorem says about multiplying two n-bit integers, in which machine model it holds, which earlier conjecture it refutes, and the overall plan the proof follows to get there." got stuck at "by the established multiplier at length $o(n)$": The page calls it the established multiplier without naming it or stating its cost, yet the total depends on it running in o(n) time on the sizes used. I accepted that without a source. (stuck at the beyond level)
- A simulated reader (reader) trying to answer "Summarise in a few sentences what the main theorem says about multiplying two n-bit integers, in which machine model it holds, which earlier conjecture it refutes, and the overall plan the proof follows to get there." got stuck at "Each of the seven powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, which the margin $2\kappa$ leaves room for": The page asserts that fixed powers of log p are eventually below p^kappa without argument. It is standard growth reasoning, but I accepted it on the page's word. (stuck at the step level)

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 576 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 720 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

Cost accounting totals the running time of every step of [The multiplication algorithm](multiplication-algorithm.md) and shows that it is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$, where $\kappa=2^{-182}$ is the saved exponent.

Let $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$ be the volume, the number of stored bits of $T$ coefficients of $p$ bits (a volume here, not the larger label of the subspace-label pages). The fixed exponents of [Parameter and prime-length choice](parameter-choice.md) are $\epsilon=2^{-75}$, $c=2^{-56}$, $\delta=1/16$, $\tau=1-2^{-50}$ and $\lambda'=1-2^{-54}$, giving $d=\Theta(p^\epsilon)$, $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$, $\ell=\Theta(p^{1-\epsilon})$ and $\alpha=\Theta(p^{1/4+\epsilon/2})$.

Dividing by $V$, seven operations dominate, each a power $p^{1-g_i}$ with margin $g_i>0$ below one (a margin, not a guard value).

| Operation | Cost$/V$ | Power of $p$ | Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prefix moves | $dK$ | $\epsilon(1+c)$ | $g_1=1-\epsilon(1+c)$ |
| Chunk exchanges | $pK^{\tau-1}$ | $1-\epsilon c(1-\tau)$ | $g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau)$ |
| Layer rounds | $\ell d^{\lambda'}$ | $1-\epsilon(1-\lambda')$ | $g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda')$ |
| Axis layouts | $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$ | $\tau+\epsilon(2-\tau)$ | $g_4=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau)$ |
| Gaussian lines | $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$ | $3/4+\delta+3\epsilon/2$ | $g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2$ |
| Chirps | $dp^\delta$ | $\epsilon+\delta$ | $g_6=1-\delta-\epsilon$ |
| Products | $\log(rp)$ | $1-\epsilon$ | $g_7=\epsilon$ |

- Prefix moves and single butterfly rounds are $O(dK)$ linear scans, each $O(V)$, in [Tape layout for synthetic transforms](transform-layout.md).
- The layout needs $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges, as $d\ell=O(p)$, each costing $O(VK^\tau)$ by [Fast address-chunk interchange](address-interchange.md). The total is $O(p/K)K^\tau=O(pK^{\tau-1})$.
- Each of at most $\ell$ rounds costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ by [Simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-layer.md).
- The [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-map.md) needs $O(d^2)$ adjacent axis moves. Each move peels one excess bit, exchanges the equal-width parts and restores it, costing $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$ <cite data-source="paper">Each costs $O(V(1+\ell^\tau))$: peel a single excess bit when widths</cite>. Here $d^2\ell^\tau=p^{2\epsilon}p^{(1-\epsilon)\tau}$.
- In [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md), axis $i$ has at most $T/t_i$ lines of cost $O(t_ip^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ each, totalling $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$.
- A chirp numerator of the [Bluestein chirp identity](chirp.md) has $O(p)$ bits and sums $d$ terms. The [Established O(n log n) multiplier](hvdh-multiplier.md), at cost $O(N\log 2N)$ on $N$ bits, computes their squares and products in $O(dp^{1+\delta})$ per entry.
- The $T/r$ ring-product records each need four products on $O(rp)$ bits after [Signed packing](signed-packing.md) by the established multiplier at length $o(n)$. The total is $O(Tp\log(rp))$, and $\log(rp)=O(p^{1-\epsilon})$ since $r\le 2^{O(p/d)}$.

Substitution gives $g_1>1/2$, $g_2=2^{-75}2^{-56}2^{-50}=2^{-181}$, $g_3=2^{-75}2^{-54}=2^{-129}$, $g_4>2^{-51}$, $g_5>1/8$, $g_6>1/2$ and $g_7=2^{-75}$, so the smallest margin is $2^{-181}=2\kappa$ <cite data-source="paper">Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.</cite>

Setup must also be negligible. A visit is a node of the butterfly-layer or address-layout recursions, or one round or group invocation inside them. They have constant branching, depth $O(\log p)$ and polynomially many rounds and groups. Fix an exponent $A$ with at most $p^A$ visits in total, and an exponent $C$ with descriptor setup of at most $p^C$ steps per visit (here $A$ and $C$ are exponents, not the shear matrix, ambient spaces, two-point kernel or selection map of earlier pages). The setup costs at most $p^{A+C}=o(Tp)$. Per-record and per-line setup is also small. A visit touches $O(T/r)$ records, so $O(p^C)$ address work per record sums to $O(Tp^{A+C}/r)$; at most $2dT/r$ Gaussian lines per tensor map cost $O(dTp^C/r)$. Both are $o(Tp)$ because $r$ exceeds every fixed power of $p$.

Exceptional addresses, where the packed shifts of [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-bit-addition.md) fail, are bounded to a fraction $O(d2^{-K})$ of addresses. Let $V_{\rm call}$ be the volume of one packed change of basis. A record has $\Theta(rp)$ payload bits and an exceptional one adds an $O(p)$-bit key, so the compact stream of exceptional records has length $O\left(\frac{V_{\rm call}}{rp}d2^{-K}(rp+p)\right)=O(V_{\rm call}d2^{-K})$. Stable bit sorting makes $O(p)$ scans of it, costing $O(V_{\rm call}dp2^{-K})$. Over at most $p^A$ visits of volume $O(V)$, and with $d=O(p^\epsilon)$, the repair costs $O(Vp^{O(1)}2^{-K})=o(V)$, because $K=\Theta(p^{\epsilon c})$ beats every power of $p$. Global setup and the prime search for the axis lengths also cost $o(V)$.

Each of the seven powers is at most $1-2\kappa$, and any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, which the margin $2\kappa$ leaves room for. The total is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$ <cite data-source="paper">O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}).</cite> Schoolbook multiplication below a fixed cutoff is absorbed <cite data-source="paper">many smaller lengths are included by enlarging the implicit constant.</cite> One machine thus runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every $n\ge1$.

The exponent is only $2^{-182}$ below one because $g_2$ multiplies three small numbers: $\epsilon$ (few axes), $c$ (narrow chunks) and $1-\tau$ (an exchange saves only $K^{-(1-\tau)}$).

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0385-write-cost-accounting.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0385-write-cost-accounting.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0385-write-cost-accounting` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0385-write-cost-accounting`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
