# exegenius task 0009-write-subset-network

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Subset-intersection network
Gloss: A linear network whose subspace labels come from intersection sizes of three-element subsets, so that the total number of smaller calls is less than the number of wires times the dimension.
Also called: three-element subset construction

## This page in the argument

The step: The subset-intersection network has a total number $s$ of smaller calls with $s<Wm$, where $W$ is its wire count and $m$ the dimension of its label space.
How: exchange the two banks with a scalar network whose gates carry subspace labels from triples, then bound the total dimension change of the labels by counting dimension losses
Why: Each edge's dimension change counts the smaller operations on that edge, so the total number of smaller calls is the sum of absolute label changes; a bound of that sum below $Wm$ gives the saving. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: the strict inequality $s<Wm$ holds with a fixed rational deficit that does not depend on the input length (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- A fixed linear network of three-element-subset gates exchanges the banks $X_a$ and $Y_a$ with signs and restores every scratch wire. (on [Linear network that restores auxiliary values](linear-network.md))
- On every route of the network the operator on each role is $D_{\mathrm{sink}}D_{\mathrm{source}}^{-1}$, so only the endpoint frames determine it. (on [Frame of a network vertex](frame.md))
- The subspace labels satisfy $L=Ich$ and the sum of absolute label changes equals $Wm-2N+2L$, with loss $L<N/2$.
- For the bit network the total rational rank $s$ of the edge differences satisfies $s<Wm$.
- For the complex network the total rank of the phase translation factors, $s_{\rm c}$, is strictly below $W_{\rm c}m$.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The construction uses three-element subsets" (paper)

  > The finite construction in Section~\ref{sec:finite-networks} attaches subspaces of a fixed $m$-dimensional space to its gates and terminals. The subspaces at adjacent vertices are nested. Their dimension changes count the smaller operations needed on an edge, with an additional source contribution in the bit construction. The construction uses three-element subsets: gather and scatter create coefficients depending on intersection size, and auxiliary wires cancel the unwanted coefficients. Orthogonality of the corresponding indicator vectors permits the subspace assignments. The decisive property is that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.
