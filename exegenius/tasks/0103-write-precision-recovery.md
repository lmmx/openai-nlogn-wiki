# exegenius task 0103-write-precision-recovery

Project directory: `/home/user/e2e-run` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Error tracking and exact recovery
Gloss: Each normalized transform and product is a contraction with a bounded rounding error, and the total error on the recovered convolution coefficients is below 1/2, so rounding gives exact integers.
Also called: synthetic transform error, source transform error

## This page in the argument

The step: The error on the recovered integer coefficients is below $1/2$, so rounding gives the exact integer coefficients, and carry propagation yields the exact binary product.
How: Track errors in units of $h_p=2^{-p}$ through every contraction and bilinear map (each computed array also stays in the disk), obtain $E_{\rm ring}<5TL$, chirp error $<8TLh_p$, source error $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$, product error $(2E_s+2)$, opposite error $(3E_s+2)$, scaled error $E_w<28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L$, and finally the coefficient error $<448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$.
Why: Each normalized transform and product is a contraction, so errors add rather than multiply; the final multiplication by the factors $2^{2b+4}S$ amplifies the error by at most $2^{2b+4}S\cdot2^{-p}$ which stays small only because $p=6b$ leaves $4b$ spare bits. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Each synthetic transform has error less than $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}<L2^{-p}$ with $L=\log_2T$.
- Use $h_p=2^{-p}$ and the sup norm throughout; an error of $a$ means error less than $ah_p$.
- For a bilinear contraction, replacing operands changes the output by at most $\|f'-f\|\|g'\|+\|f\|\|g'-g\|$.
- Hence, for disk operands, the two input errors add.
- A computed phase product satisfies $\|Q_p(\widetilde ex)-ex\|<(2\|x\|+\sqrt2)h_p<4h_p$ and $\|Q_p(\widetilde ex)\|\le\|x\|$.
- The ring convolution error is $E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL$, and its output has norm below $.701$ when one operand has norm at most $.7$.
- The computed complex convolution has error less than $(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p$: two input twists, the ring approximation and the output untwist.
- The chirp transform has error $\|\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)-QF_{\boldsymbol t}x\|<(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p$.
- The source transform (error $2dp^2+8TL$ before scaling, then multiplied by $2^\gamma$) has error less than $E_sh_p$ with $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$, using $2dp^2<TL$ eventually.
- The computed product $z=Q_p(\widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1)$ has $\|z-U\cdot V_1\|<(2E_s+2)h_p$: two terms of norm below $E_sh_p$ each, plus truncation.
- The opposite transform gives error less than $(3E_s+2)h_p$ relative to $G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2$.
- After the first exact multiplication by $S$: $\widetilde w$ approximates $w=(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_wh_p$, $E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L$.
- After the second scaling by $2^{2b+4}S$ the absolute error is $2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b}$.
- Using $S\le T<2^b$, $L<b$ it is less than $448b\,2^{-b+\gamma}$.
- Since $\gamma\le b/4$ for $b\ge2^{24}$ it is at most $448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$.
- The true coefficients are integers, so the strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to the represented value the unique correct coefficient.
- The carries obey $k_0=0$, $d_j=(c_j+k_j)\bmod Q_0$, $k_{j+1}=\lfloor(c_j+k_j)/Q_0\rfloor$ with $Q_0=2^b$.
- The carries satisfy $0\le k_j\le q(Q_0-1)<Q_0^2$: if this holds at $j$, then $c_j+k_j\le q(Q_0-1)^2+q(Q_0-1)=qQ_0(Q_0-1)$.
- The invariant $\sum_{h<j}c_hQ_0^h=\sum_{h<j}d_hQ_0^h+k_jQ_0^j$ shows the first $j$ radix digits are fixed.
- The exact product is less than $2^{2n}$, so all bits above position $2n-1$ are zero and exactly $2n$ bits are output.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic Turing machine with a fixed finite alphabet and a fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture of Sch\"onhage and Strassen in this model.; how: Build two power-saving tape procedures (chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layer) from fixed finite linear networks; use them to accelerate the synthetic polynomial transforms and ring convolution; use Gaussian resampling with retained permutations and chirps to reduce the prime-length cyclic convolution of the radix-digit coefficients to those power-of-two transforms; assemble the exact product with a proof that the error is below $1/2$; and total the cost to show a power of $\log n$ is saved. (on [Power-saving integer multiplication](main-result.md))
- The exact $2n$-bit product of the two inputs is obtained from the radix-digit convolution by the chain: radix digits, Chinese-remainder address map to a product of prime cyclic axes, two forward source transforms (resampling and chirps), pointwise product, opposite transform, rescaling, rounding, and carry propagation, with total error below $1/2$.; how: Reduce the integer product to a cyclic convolution of $S$ short coefficients and compute it through the chain of reductions (digits, CRT address map, Gaussian resampling with chirps, twist to the polynomial ring, synthetic-transform convolution); recover exact integers because the accumulated error is below $1/2$.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S5.7.1, S5.7.2, S5.7.3, S5.7.4, S5.7.5, S5.7.6, S5.7.7, S5.7.8, S5.7.9, S5.7.10, S5.7.11, S5.7.12, S5.7.13, S5.7.14, S5.7.15, S5.7.16, S5.7.17, S5.7.18, S5.7.19, S5.7.20). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S5.7.1**: Each synthetic transform has error less than $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}<L2^{-p}$ with $L=\log_2T$.
Source: "$\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}<L2^{-p}$, where $L=\log_2T$, for all" (paper)
> Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer} uses $C_1=20$, so $\epsilon C_1<1$ makes its coefficient width $O(p)$. Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost} therefore applies to every synthetic transform here, with error less than $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}<L2^{-p}$, where $L=\log_2T$, for all sufficiently large $n$.

**S5.7.2**: Use $h_p=2^{-p}$ and the sup norm throughout; an error of $a$ means error less than $ah_p$.
Source: "Put $h_p=2^{-p}$, and use the coefficient sup norm throughout this" (paper)
> Put $h_p=2^{-p}$, and use the coefficient sup norm throughout this subsection. An error of $a$ will mean absolute error less than $ah_p$. A linear contraction propagates an input error without increasing it. For a bilinear contraction $\mathcal M$, replacing its operands gives \[ \|\mathcal M(f',g')-\mathcal M(f,g)\| \le \|f'-f\|\,\|g'\|+\|f\|\,\|g'-g\|. \] When all four operands are in the disk, their two errors therefore add.

**S5.7.3**: For a bilinear contraction, replacing operands changes the output by at most $\|f'-f\|\|g'\|+\|f\|\|g'-g\|$.
Source: "\|\mathcal M(f',g')-\mathcal M(f,g)\|" (paper)
> Put $h_p=2^{-p}$, and use the coefficient sup norm throughout this subsection. An error of $a$ will mean absolute error less than $ah_p$. A linear contraction propagates an input error without increasing it. For a bilinear contraction $\mathcal M$, replacing its operands gives \[ \|\mathcal M(f',g')-\mathcal M(f,g)\| \le \|f'-f\|\,\|g'\|+\|f\|\,\|g'-g\|. \] When all four operands are in the disk, their two errors therefore add.

**S5.7.4**: Hence, for disk operands, the two input errors add.
Source: "\le \|f'-f\|\,\|g'\|+\|f\|\,\|g'-g\|." (paper)
> Put $h_p=2^{-p}$, and use the coefficient sup norm throughout this subsection. An error of $a$ will mean absolute error less than $ah_p$. A linear contraction propagates an input error without increasing it. For a bilinear contraction $\mathcal M$, replacing its operands gives \[ \|\mathcal M(f',g')-\mathcal M(f,g)\| \le \|f'-f\|\,\|g'\|+\|f\|\,\|g'-g\|. \] When all four operands are in the disk, their two errors therefore add.

**S5.7.5**: A computed phase product satisfies $\|Q_p(\widetilde ex)-ex\|<(2\|x\|+\sqrt2)h_p<4h_p$ and $\|Q_p(\widetilde ex)\|\le\|x\|$.
Source: "<(2\|x\|+\sqrt2)h_p<4h_p," (paper)
> We also need the norm as well as the error of a computed phase product. Let $e$ be a unit phase, let $\widetilde e$ be a disk-grid approximation with $|\widetilde e-e|<2h_p$, and let $x$ be a disk operand. The truncation bound in \eqref{eq:transform-truncate} gives \[ \|Q_p(\widetilde e x)-ex\| <(2\|x\|+\sqrt2)h_p<4h_p, \qquad \|Q_p(\widetilde e x)\|\le\|x\|. \] The second inequality follows from $|\widetilde e|\le1$ and the fact that $Q_p$ does not increase the norm. It preserves every smaller operand norm through a twist or an endpoint phase multiplication. The same bounds hold coordinatewise for arrays of phases.

**S5.7.6**: The ring convolution error is $E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL$, and its output has norm below $.701$ when one operand has norm at most $.7$.
Source: "E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL." (paper)
> For disk-grid ring arrays $f,g$, put $M=T/r$. Two normalized synthetic forwards, pointwise polynomial multiplication divided by $r$, and the normalized opposite transform give $(f*g)/(rM^2)$. The exact multiplication by $M$ in Proposition~\ref{prop:synthetic-convolution} then gives $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$. Before that multiplication, the three transform errors and the polynomial-product truncation total less than $3L+2$. Thus the error of the returned normalized convolution is bounded by \[ E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL. \] If one operand has norm at most $.7$, bilinear contraction gives $\|\mathcal M_r(f,g)\|\le.7$. Its computed grid output consequently has norm less than $.7+5TLh_p<.701$ for large $n$. This proves the disk margin after the scale $M$, without clipping the output.

**S5.7.7**: The computed complex convolution has error less than $(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p$: two input twists, the ring approximation and the output untwist.
Source: "<(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p." (paper)
> To compare it with $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)$, insert the exact normalized $\mathcal M_r$ at $\iota f'$ and $\iota g'$. Its bilinear contraction bound propagates the two input twist errors, each less than $4$. Its approximation contributes $E_{\rm ring}$, and the output untwist contributes less than $4$. All these comparisons are at the normalized $\mathcal M_r$ interface, after its factor $M$. They give \[ \|\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(f,g) -\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)\| <(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p. \]

**S5.7.8**: The chirp transform has error $\|\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)-QF_{\boldsymbol t}x\|<(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p$.
Source: "<(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p." (paper)
> For its error, the exact operands $a$ and $\overline a\cdot x$ are in the disk because every entry of $a$ has modulus one. The kernel approximation contributes less than $2$ and the first endpoint multiplication contributes less than $4$ when inserted into the exact bilinear contraction $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}$. The computed convolution contributes less than $6TL$, and the last endpoint multiplication less than $4$. Equation~\eqref{eq:permuted-chirp} identifies the exact result, so \[ \|\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)-QF_{\boldsymbol t}x\| <(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p. \]

**S5.7.9**: The source transform (error $2dp^2+8TL$ before scaling, then multiplied by $2^\gamma$) has error less than $E_sh_p$ with $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$, using $2dp^2<TL$ eventually.
Source: "E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL," (paper)
> Finally let the input to a source transform have norm at most $.5$. The computed expansion has error less than $dp^2$ and norm less than $.5+dp^2h_p<.51$. It is therefore a permitted chirp input. The chirp output is in the disk by the preceding argument, so each compression call is defined and returns another disk-grid array. Insert the exact contractions $\mathcal A$, $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, and $\mathcal B_0$ at the computed inputs. The error before the source scale is less than $2dp^2+8TL$. Multiplication by $2^\gamma$ therefore gives error less than $2^\gamma(2dp^2+8TL)h_p$, which is bounded by $E_sh_p$ with \begin{equation}\label{eq:source-error} E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL, \end{equation} because $2dp^2<TL$ eventually. The exact source transform $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ is a contraction, so the scaled approximation has norm at most $.5+E_sh_p<.501$. Its exact numerator scaling therefore also leaves a disk-grid output without clipping. Conjugation preserves the grid and norm, so the opposite procedure has the same error and disk guarantee. All these margins may be enforced by one fixed cutoff. For example, $b\ge2^{24}$, together with the other eventual construction conditions, makes $dp^2h_p$, $8TLh_p$, $E_sh_p$ and $28\,2^\gamma T^2Lh_p$ smaller than $10^{-3}$.

**S5.7.10**: The computed product $z=Q_p(\widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1)$ has $\|z-U\cdot V_1\|<(2E_s+2)h_p$: two terms of norm below $E_sh_p$ each, plus truncation.
Source: "Thus $\|z-U\cdot V_1\|<(2E_s+2)h_p$." (paper)
> The scaled radix digits in $u,v$ are exact $p$-bit grid values of norm strictly less than $1/4$. Put \[ \begin{aligned} U&=RF_{\boldsymbol s}u,&\qquad V_1&=RF_{\boldsymbol s}v,\\ \widetilde U&=\widetilde{\mathscr F}(u),& \widetilde V_1&=\widetilde{\mathscr F}(v). \end{aligned} \] The exact arrays have norm less than $1/4$, and the computed arrays have norm less than $1/4+E_sh_p<.26$. Hence $z=Q_p(\widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1)$ has norm at most $.26^2<.5$. To estimate its error, write \[ \widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1-U\cdot V_1 =(\widetilde U-U)\cdot\widetilde V_1 +U\cdot(\widetilde V_1-V_1). \] The factors $\widetilde V_1$ and $U$ are in the disk. The two terms have total norm less than $2E_sh_p$, and truncation adds less than $2h_p$. Thus $\|z-U\cdot V_1\|<(2E_s+2)h_p$.

**S5.7.11**: The opposite transform gives error less than $(3E_s+2)h_p$ relative to $G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2$.
Source: "&<(3E_s+2)h_p." (paper)
> Let $G:=RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$ be the exact opposite contraction. Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}, applied to $U=RF_{\boldsymbol s}u$ and $V_1=RF_{\boldsymbol s}v$, gives \[ G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2. \] The computed opposite transform may be applied to $z$ because $\|z\|<.5$. Insert $G$ at that computed input: \[ \begin{aligned} \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-G(U\cdot V_1)\| &\le \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-Gz\|\\ &\qquad+\|G(z-U\cdot V_1)\|\\ &<(3E_s+2)h_p. \end{aligned} \] The first exact numerator multiplication by $S$ gives $\widetilde w$, approximating $w=(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_wh_p$, where \[ E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\,2^\gamma T^2L. \] Each coefficient of $w$ is an average of $S$ products of coefficients of $u$ and $v$, so $\|w\|<1/16$. The earlier cutoff therefore gives \[ \|\widetilde w\|<1/16+E_wh_p<1/16+10^{-3}<1. \] This proves the disk bound for the computed first scaled result.

**S5.7.12**: After the first exact multiplication by $S$: $\widetilde w$ approximates $w=(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_wh_p$, $E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L$.
Source: "E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\,2^\gamma T^2L." (paper)
> Let $G:=RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$ be the exact opposite contraction. Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}, applied to $U=RF_{\boldsymbol s}u$ and $V_1=RF_{\boldsymbol s}v$, gives \[ G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2. \] The computed opposite transform may be applied to $z$ because $\|z\|<.5$. Insert $G$ at that computed input: \[ \begin{aligned} \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-G(U\cdot V_1)\| &\le \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-Gz\|\\ &\qquad+\|G(z-U\cdot V_1)\|\\ &<(3E_s+2)h_p. \end{aligned} \] The first exact numerator multiplication by $S$ gives $\widetilde w$, approximating $w=(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_wh_p$, where \[ E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\,2^\gamma T^2L. \] Each coefficient of $w$ is an average of $S$ products of coefficients of $u$ and $v$, so $\|w\|<1/16$. The earlier cutoff therefore gives \[ \|\widetilde w\|<1/16+E_wh_p<1/16+10^{-3}<1. \] This proves the disk bound for the computed first scaled result.

**S5.7.13**: After the second scaling by $2^{2b+4}S$ the absolute error is $2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b}$.
Source: "2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\,2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b}" (paper)
> In tensor order, the unscaled integer coefficient array is $2^{2b+4}S w$. This second occurrence of $S$ reverses the normalization still present in $w$, and $2^{2b+4}$ reverses the two input scales. Both multiplications act exactly on grid numerators. Since $S\le T<2^b$ and $L<b$ eventually, the final absolute error is less than \begin{equation}\label{eq:final-error} 2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\,2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b} <448b\,2^{-b+\gamma} \le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12. \end{equation} The true coefficients are real integers. If $H_j$ is the real numerator after the second scaling, its represented value is $H_j/2^p$. The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to that value the unique correct coefficient.

**S5.7.14**: Using $S\le T<2^b$, $L<b$ it is less than $448b\,2^{-b+\gamma}$.
Source: "<448b\,2^{-b+\gamma}" (paper)

> After $\Phi^{-1}$ the coefficients occur in increasing ordinary index, so this carry scan proceeds from least to most significant. Carry storage and work per coefficient are $O(b)$ bits and steps. Write each digit's bits from low to high on a work tape, and drain the final $O(b)$-bit carry in the same order. Copy the completed stream backward once to obtain most-significant-first order. The stream has length $O(Sb)=O(Tp)$, including chunk padding and the final carry, so this reversal is a charged linear tape pass. The exact product is less than $2^{2n}$; all bits above position $2n-1$ are therefore zero. Remove only those zero padding bits and retain leading zeros as needed to produce exactly $2n$ bits. Zero inputs obey the same invariant and output rule.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "proves that the recovered coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$" (paper)

  > Finally, the source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product, and the opposite-sign transform. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} removes the known normalizations and digit scales, proves that the recovered coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$, and propagates carries to obtain the exact binary product. A compatible choice of rational parameters makes all terms in its cost table fit Theorem~\ref{thm:main}. Figure~\ref{fig:multiplication-flow} summarizes these reductions.

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "for unit phase $e,$ approximation $\widetilde e,$ disk operand $x.$" (Missing hypothesis: the paper (lines 4568-4576) requires the approximation to be a disk-grid number with |e~ - e| < 2h_p (so |e~| <= 1). Without that the bounds 4h_p and ||Q_p(e~x)|| <= ||x|| do not follow.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "With $M=T/r$ the ring record count, the ring convolution error is $E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL,$" (The page does not say why the transform errors are multiplied by M (the normalized result is rescaled by an exact multiplication by M, paper lines 4582-4592), nor what the ring convolution is.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "its output has norm below $.701$ when one operand has norm at most $.7.$" (No reason is given: it needs the bilinear contraction bound (<= .7) plus the error 5TL*h_p being tiny for large n (paper 4593-4596). Neither the contraction bound nor the largeness condition appears on the page.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The opposite transform gives error less than $(3E_s+2)h_p$" (The page gives no derivation: it is E_s (computed opposite transform vs exact G applied to z) plus (2E_s+2) (G is a contraction applied to z - U.V_1), and it needs ||z|| < .5 so the computed transform is defined (paper 4695-4704).). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "$G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2,$" (An identity about the transforms that the page never states or justifies; it is the chirp-permutation lemma in the paper (4689-4694). The reader cannot see why three transforms of the convolution give (u*v)/S^2.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "undoing $1/S$ and the input scales" (The page never says the digit arrays u,v are scaled (each by 2^-(b+2), giving norm < 1/4), so the factor 2^{2b+4} and the norm bounds needed to stay in the disk are unexplained.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Using $S\le T<2^b,$ $L<b$" (The page never relates T, S, L to b, so the reader cannot check T < 2^b and L < b. Both hold only eventually for large n (paper 4722).). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "$4b$ spare bits remain; scaling spends $3b+4.$" (Inconsistent arithmetic: with p=6b and scaling spending 3b+4 bits, 6b-(3b+4)=3b-4 bits remain, not 4b. The paper has no such statement (the scaling widths are at lines 4737-4743), so the '(cited)' attribution is also unsupported.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Dividing by $Q_0$ and $q\le n\le Q_0$ finish the step." (The page never says why n <= 2^b (b is only called the bits per digit); this comes from the parameter choice (paper 4193). Without it q(Q_0-1) < Q_0^2 does not follow.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "each step adds $c_jQ_0^j=(d_j+Q_0k_{j+1})Q_0^j;$" (False: from c_j+k_j=d_j+Q_0k_{j+1} (paper 4785) one gets c_j = d_j+Q_0k_{j+1}-k_j, so c_jQ_0^j=(d_j+Q_0k_{j+1}-k_j)Q_0^j. The -k_jQ_0^j term is what cancels the old k_jQ_0^j on the right side; as written the invariant would not carry from j to j+1.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 349 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 436 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

Error tracking and exact recovery shows the error is below $1/2,$ so rounding is exact.

The computation runs on [Fixed-point Gaussian dyadic records](fixed-point.md). Let $b$ be the bits per radix digit, $p=6b$ the fractional bits, $T$ the padded array size, $S\le T$ the convolution length, $L=\log_2T,$ $\gamma$ the source scale exponent, $d$ the axis count.

Use $h_p=2^{-p}$ and the sup norm throughout; an error of $a$ means error less than $ah_p.$ Each synthetic transform has error less than $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}<L2^{-p}$ with $L=\log_2T,$ where $\ell=\log_2r.$

Replacing the operands of a bilinear contraction $\mathcal B$ by $f',g'$ changes the output by at most $\|f'-f\|\|g'\|+\|f\|\|g'-g\|,$ since $\mathcal B(f',g')-\mathcal B(f,g)=\mathcal B(f'-f,g')+\mathcal B(f,g'-g).$ Hence, for disk operands, the two input errors add.

A computed phase product satisfies $\|Q_p(\widetilde ex)-ex\|<(2\|x\|+\sqrt2)h_p<4h_p$ and $\|Q_p(\widetilde ex)\|\le\|x\|,$ for unit phase $e,$ approximation $\widetilde e,$ disk operand $x.$

With $M=T/r$ the ring record count, the ring convolution error is $E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL,$ and its output has norm below $.701$ when one operand has norm at most $.7.$ Here $3L+2$ is three transforms and a truncation.

The computed complex convolution has error less than $(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p:$ two input twists, the ring approximation and the output untwist. The chirp transform has error $\|\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)-QF_{\boldsymbol t}x\|<(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p.$

The source transform (error $2dp^2+8TL$ before scaling, then multiplied by $2^\gamma$) has error less than $E_sh_p$ with $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL,$ using $2dp^2<TL$ eventually.

For scaled digit arrays $u,v$ with exact transforms $U,V_1$ and computed $\widetilde U,\widetilde V_1.$ The computed product $z=Q_p(\widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1)$ has $\|z-U\cdot V_1\|<(2E_s+2)h_p:$ two terms of norm below $E_sh_p$ each, plus truncation. Use $\widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1-U\cdot V_1=(\widetilde U-U)\cdot\widetilde V_1+U\cdot(\widetilde V_1-V_1).$ The opposite transform gives error less than $(3E_s+2)h_p$ relative to $G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2,$ with $G$ exact.

After the first exact multiplication by $S:$ $\widetilde w$ approximates $w=(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_wh_p,$ $E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L.$ After the second scaling by $2^{2b+4}S,$ undoing $1/S$ and the input scales, the absolute error is $2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b}.$ Using $S\le T<2^b,$ $L<b$ it is less than $448b\,2^{-b+\gamma}.$ Since $\gamma\le b/4$ for $b\ge2^{24}$ it is at most $448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2.$ <cite data-source="paper">$b\ge2^{24}$ implies $\gamma\le b/4$</cite> With $p=6b,$ $4b$ spare bits remain; scaling spends $3b+4.$

The true coefficients are integers, so the strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to the represented value the unique correct coefficient.

We recover the coefficients $c_j$ of the [Multiplication as radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md), which satisfy $c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2,$ with $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ the digits in an $n$-bit input. The carries obey $k_0=0,$ $d_j=(c_j+k_j)\bmod Q_0,$ $k_{j+1}=\lfloor(c_j+k_j)/Q_0\rfloor$ with $Q_0=2^b.$

The carries satisfy $0\le k_j\le q(Q_0-1)<Q_0^2:$ if this holds at $j,$ then $c_j+k_j\le q(Q_0-1)^2+q(Q_0-1)=qQ_0(Q_0-1).$ Dividing by $Q_0$ and $q\le n\le Q_0$ finish the step.

The invariant $\sum_{h<j}c_hQ_0^h=\sum_{h<j}d_hQ_0^h+k_jQ_0^j$ shows the first $j$ radix digits are fixed. It holds at $j=0,$ and each step adds $c_jQ_0^j=(d_j+Q_0k_{j+1})Q_0^j;$ unprocessed terms are multiples of $Q_0^j.$

The exact product is less than $2^{2n},$ so all bits above position $2n-1$ are zero and exactly $2n$ bits are output.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0103-write-precision-recovery.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0103-write-precision-recovery.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0103-write-precision-recovery` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0103-write-precision-recovery`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
