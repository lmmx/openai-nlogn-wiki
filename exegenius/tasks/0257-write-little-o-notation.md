# exegenius task 0257-write-little-o-notation

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Little-o notation
Gloss: A function f is o(g) when the ratio f/g tends to zero, a stronger statement than being O(g).
Also called: limit as lambda tends to infinity

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Exact multiplication of two $n$-bit integers runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time on one deterministic fixed-tape machine, with $\kappa = 2^{-182}$. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))
- The parameters can be chosen so that every term in the cost table is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for $\kappa = 2^{-182}$, which gives the bound of the theorem.

## Evidence from the sources

- "γ = o(b). For example b ≥ 224 implies γ ≤ b/4." (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "a ratio that tends to zero is eventually at most $1$" (The claim that a ratio tending to zero is eventually at most 1 relies on the limit concept, which the reader cannot follow from the page, so the claim that little-o implies big-O is not checkable.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Little-o notation bounds the cost of the multiplication machine strictly below $n\lg n$: its running time is $o(n\lg n)$, not merely $O(n\lg n)$." (The page asserts that the machine's running time is o(n lg n) but does not show that the main result's bound applies to this machine, nor why the stated bound with kappa = 2^(-182) gives that conclusion; the reader cannot check this from the page.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "(\lg n)^{-\kappa} \longrightarrow 0 \qquad (n \to \infty)" (The step needs that lg n grows without bound and that a negative power of such a quantity tends to zero. Neither is stated, and the reader's profile does not cover limits, so the reader cannot check the limit.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "which contradicts $T_A(n)/(n\lg n) \ge c_A > 0$" (The contradiction needs the fact that a sequence bounded below by a positive constant cannot tend to zero. This depends on the limit concept the reader does not know.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "The paper states the saving as a limit in the same way:." (The sentence refers to a statement in the paper that the page never gives, and it ends in a colon with nothing after it, so the reader cannot check what the paper states.)
- Explain "integer multiplication result below n lg n" inline: its concept depends on this page, so it cannot be a prerequisite.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 355 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 443 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

Little-o notation says that one function is negligible next to another. It is the form in which the integer multiplication result below $n\lg n$ states that its cost falls strictly below $n\lg n$, and so it is what turns the saving into a refutation of the optimality conjecture.

The variable $\lambda$ is the real point at which both functions are evaluated, and it is taken to infinity. The function $\varphi$ is the one being bounded, a map from the positive reals to the positive reals. The function $\psi$ is the comparison function, a map from the positive reals to the positive reals that is positive for all large $\lambda$.

We write $\varphi(\lambda) = o(\psi(\lambda))$ as $\lambda \to \infty$ when the ratio tends to zero:

$$\lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \frac{\varphi(\lambda)}{\psi(\lambda)} = 0.$$

Every function that is $o(\psi)$ is also $O(\psi)$, since a ratio that tends to zero is eventually at most $1$. The converse fails. For example $2\lambda$ is $O(\lambda)$, yet $2\lambda/\lambda = 2$ does not tend to zero, so $2\lambda$ is not $o(\lambda)$. By contrast $\lambda = o(\lambda^2)$, because $\lambda/\lambda^2 = 1/\lambda$ tends to zero.

The bound of the main result has the form $n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa}$ with $\kappa = 2^{-182}$, where $n$ is the input length and $\lg n$ is the binary logarithm. Dividing by $n\lg n$ gives

$$\frac{n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa}}{n\lg n} = (\lg n)^{-\kappa} \longrightarrow 0 \qquad (n \to \infty),$$

because $\kappa > 0$. The saving is therefore a power of the logarithm, and little-o records that this saving eventually falls below every positive constant. Little-o notation bounds the cost of the multiplication machine strictly below $n\lg n$: its running time is $o(n\lg n)$, not merely $O(n\lg n)$.

The optimality conjecture asserts a lower bound $T_A(n) \ge c_A\, n\lg n$ for a positive constant $c_A$ and all large $n$. Dividing by $n\lg n$ shows that a machine whose time is $o(n\lg n)$ has $T_A(n)/(n\lg n) \to 0$, which contradicts $T_A(n)/(n\lg n) \ge c_A > 0$. The paper states the saving as a limit in the same way: <cite data-source="paper">The power saving proved here gives a limit of zero through all input lengths</cite>.

The paper uses the notation in its own estimates to say that a quantity is negligible against a parameter: <cite data-source="paper">γ = o(b). For example b ≥ 224 implies γ ≤ b/4.</cite>
