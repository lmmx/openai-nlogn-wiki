# exegenius task 0039-write-synthetic-transform

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Synthetic polynomial transform
Gloss: The normalized transforms F_t^± over the polynomial ring using synthetic roots, computed by radix-two butterflies plus monomial twiddles (Nussbaumer–Quandalle); character cancellation gives F⁺F⁻ = I/t even though the ring has zero divisors.

## This page in the argument

The step: The normalized transforms $F_t^\pm$ over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ with synthetic roots $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$ are computed by radix-two butterflies plus monomial twiddles, and $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$ even though the ring has zero divisors.
How: Prove character cancellation directly by pairing summands, then compute the transform by the decimation-in-frequency recursion that halves the length at each level.
Why: The ring has zero divisors, so character sums cannot be evaluated by dividing by $\omega_t^j-1$ and must be checked directly. (the sources say so: "The ring has zero divisors, so we verify character cancellation" (paper))
Striking feature: The identity $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$ holds in a ring with zero divisors because each non-vanishing character sum pairs its terms into cancelling pairs, using that multiplication by $y^r=-1$ flips the sign and the additive group has no two-torsion. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- For $t\nmid j$, shifting $k$ by $t/2^{v+1}$ permutes the summands and multiplies the sum by $y^{rj_0}=-1$, so the sum is zero.
- A step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$ by $H_0$, multiplies the second output by $\omega_t^{-k}$ and recurses on both halves, computing $F_t^-$ in $\log_2 t$ levels.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce multiplication to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ through radix digits, Chinese-remainder axes, Gaussian resampling and chirps, speed up the data movement and the butterfly arithmetic with two network-based tape procedures with a strict rank saving, recover the exact product by rounding and carries, and add up the costs. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Normalized convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$ over $\mathcal R_r$ on disk-grid arrays is approximated with error below $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ in time $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$.; how: Apply the forward synthetic transform to both operands and keep their layout, multiply the corresponding length-$r$ records pointwise by signed packing, and apply the opposite transform, which consumes the same stored order. (on [Convolution from the retained transform layout](synthetic-convolution.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (H1.1, H1.2). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**H1.1**: For $t\nmid j$, shifting $k$ by $t/2^{v+1}$ permutes the summands and multiplies the sum by $y^{rj_0}=-1$, so the sum is zero.
Source: "Only the second case needs proof.  Write $j=2^v j_0$ with $j_0$ odd" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[Synthetic character cancellation] \label{lem:synthetic-characters} If $j$ is an integer, then \[ \sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{jk} =\begin{cases}t,&t\mid j,\\0,&t\nmid j.\end{cases} \qquad F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I. \] \end{lemma} \begin{proof} Only the second case needs proof. Write $j=2^v j_0$ with $j_0$ odd and $0\leq v<\log_2t$. Replacing $k$ by $k+t/2^{v+1}$ modulo $t$ permutes the summands and multiplies their sum by $y^{rj_0}=-1$. Hence the sum is zero, since the additive group of $\mathcal R_r$ has no two-torsion. Expanding the composite transforms and applying this identity proves the final formula. \end{proof}

**H1.2**: A step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$ by $H_0$, multiplies the second output by $\omega_t^{-k}$ and recurses on both halves, computing $F_t^-$ in $\log_2 t$ levels.
Source: "The length-one procedure is the identity.  For $t\geq2$, the" (paper)
> Write \[ H_0=\frac12\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}. \] The length-one procedure is the identity. For $t\geq2$, the decimation-in-frequency step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$ for $0\leq k<t/2$. The two outputs of $H_0$ occupy these same slots, whose high address bit is $b=0$ or $b=1$, respectively. Multiply the $b=1$ output by $\omega_t^{-k}$, and then apply the length-$t/2$ procedure separately within the two branches. This computes $F_t^-$ because, for $b\in\{0,1\}$, \begin{equation} (F_t^-z)_{2h+b} =\frac1{t/2}\sum_{k=0}^{t/2-1} (\omega_t^2)^{-hk}\omega_t^{-bk} \frac{z_k+(-1)^b z_{k+t/2}}2. \label{eq:synthetic-dif} \end{equation} To follow the recursion, name the original address-bit slots of an axis of length $t=2^a$ by $a-1,\ldots,0$, from most to least significant. For $0\leq s\leq a$, after $s$ le

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Synthetic root of unity ω_t = y^{2r/t}](synthetic-roots.md): Powers of y serve as roots of unity of order t dividing 2r in the ring modulo y^r+1, so multiplying by ω_t^j costs only a signed shift of the coefficient list.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transform *<predicate>* Synthetic root of unity ω_t = y^{2r/t}
- [Butterfly step and decimation-in-frequency recursion](fft-butterfly.md): The two-point step H₀(u,v) = ((u+v)/2,(u−v)/2) paired with a twiddle multiplication; applying it recursively on halves computes a length-2^a transform in a levels.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transform *<predicate>* Butterfly step and decimation-in-frequency recursion
- [Multidimensional transform and cyclic convolution on a product of axes](multidim-dft.md): The tensor product of one-dimensional DFTs along several axes of a box of coordinates, acting on arrays indexed by a product of cyclic groups.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transform *<predicate>* Multidimensional transform and cyclic convolution on a product of axes

## Pages that build on this one

- Retained stored frequency order: The decimation-in-frequency recursion writes frequency j in slot rev(j) (bit-reversed); the forward transform B·F⁻ keeps this order and the opposite procedure consumes it directly, so no sort is needed between the pointwise product and the inverse.
- Transform layout and cost: A positional permutation L moves chosen bit slots to a prefix and groups the remaining bits into K-bit chunks so each transform round is a simultaneous butterfly layer; cost O(Tp[dK + pK^{τ−1} + ℓ d^{λ'}]) with error below √2·ℓ·2^{−p}.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

- "Synthetic character cancellation" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Synthetic character cancellation] \label{lem:synthetic-characters} If $j$ is an integer, then \[ \sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{jk} =\begin{cases}t,&t\mid j,\\0,&t\nmid j.\end{cases} \qquad F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I. \] \end{lemma} \begin{proof} Only the second case needs proof. Write $j=2^v j_0$ with $j_0$ odd and $0\leq v<\log_2t$. Replacing $k$ by $k+t/2^{v+1}$ modulo $t$ permutes the summands and multiplies their sum by $y^{rj_0}=-1$. Hence the sum is zero, since the additive group of $\mathcal R_r$ has no two-torsion. Expanding the composite transforms and applying this identity proves the final formula. \end{proof}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-synthetic-transform.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-synthetic-transform.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0039-write-synthetic-transform` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-synthetic-transform`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
