# exegenius task 0029-write-synthetic-transform

Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F2B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader is an undergraduate computer scientist: fluent in asymptotic analysis, discrete mathematics (sets, functions, modular arithmetic, primes and gcd, permutations, induction and recursion), first-course linear algebra (matrices, invertibility, rank, basis, dimension, linear maps over the rationals and the complex numbers), complex arithmetic with Euler's formula, and the basic Turing machine model with tapes and step counting. They have seen binary representation, bit operations such as XOR, and perhaps the idea of multiplying integers by divide and conquer, but have not been taught the discrete Fourier transform, the FFT, polynomial transforms, Schönhage–Strassen, abstract ring theory beyond the basic definition, tensor products, or numerical error analysis, and these are what the wiki must explain.

## This page

Concept: Synthetic Fourier transform modulo y^r + 1
Gloss: A Fourier transform over the ring modulo y^r + 1 whose roots of unity are powers of y, so twiddle multiplications are signed coefficient shifts; it satisfies a character-cancellation identity despite zero divisors.
Heading: Synthetic Fourier transform modulo $y^r + 1$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $y$ (ring variable): the formal variable of the polynomial ring, subject to y^r = -1.
- $r$ (record length): the number of complex coefficients in a polynomial record, a power of two.

## This page in the argument

The step: The synthetic roots $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$ satisfy character cancellation despite zero divisors, so $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Start from the Gaussian-resampling reduction of integer multiplication to convolution; replace the two costly operations of the synthetic transforms (address rearrangement and butterfly layers) by faster procedures built from one recursive linear-network exchange, assemble the exact algorithm, and account for its cost. (on [Multiplying n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Normalized convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$ of arrays over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ is computed from the retained transform layout with error below $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ in $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$ time.; how: Apply the synthetic forward transform to both operands, multiply pointwise in the retained frequency order with signed packed products, apply the opposite transform that consumes that order, and scale by $M$. (on [Convolution over the polynomial ring from the retained layout](ring-convolution.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1](negacyclic-ring.md): The ring of complex polynomials of degree below r with y^r = −1, where multiplication by a power of y is a signed shift of the coefficient list.
  Shown as: Synthetic Fourier transform modulo y^r + 1 *<predicate>* Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1
- [Normalized DFT and cyclic convolution](dft-cyclic-convolution.md): The length-q discrete Fourier transform with 1/q normalization turns cyclic convolution into pointwise multiplication; its inverse uses the opposite sign of the exponent.
  Shown as: Synthetic Fourier transform modulo y^r + 1 *<predicate>* Normalized DFT and cyclic convolution
- [Multidimensional (tensor) Fourier transform](multidim-transform.md): The tensor product of one-dimensional transforms along several axes; a transform on an array with axis lengths t_1,…,t_d is applied axis by axis.
  Shown as: Synthetic Fourier transform modulo y^r + 1 *<predicate>* Multidimensional (tensor) Fourier transform

## Pages that build on this one

- Radix-2 butterfly layers and stored frequency order: Decimation in frequency: each level combines entries k and k+t/2 by the two-point butterfly H₀ and a twiddle monomial, leaving frequencies stored in bit-reversed order, which the opposite transform consumes directly.
- Layout and cost of the synthetic transform: A positional layout permutation puts the selected bits of all axes at a common offset in K-bit chunks so each transform round is one simultaneous layer; the forward transform keeps its output order for the pointwise product and the opposite transform.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "For a power of two $t$ dividing $2r$, define $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$." (paper)

  > For a power of two $t$ dividing $2r$, define $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$. For $z\in\mathcal R_r^t$ and $0\leq j<t$, set \[ (F_t^-z)_j=\frac1t\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{-jk}z_k, \qquad (F_t^+z)_j=\frac1t\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{jk}z_k. \] Every power of $\omega_t$ is an isometry, and each transform entry is an average of $t$ such images. Thus both transforms are contractions. The ring has zero divisors, so we verify character cancellation directly instead of dividing by $\omega_t^j-1$.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0029-write-synthetic-transform.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0029-write-synthetic-transform.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0029-write-synthetic-transform` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0029-write-synthetic-transform`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
