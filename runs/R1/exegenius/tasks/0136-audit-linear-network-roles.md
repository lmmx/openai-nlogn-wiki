# exegenius task 0136-audit-linear-network-roles

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has finished an undergraduate computer science degree: asymptotic analysis, discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes, binary representation, induction), introductory linear algebra (vectors, matrices, inverses, dot products), and the calculus the degree requires (limits, convergence of sequences and series, basic integrals). They know basic Turing machines with several tapes and standard algorithm analysis, including recurrences and schoolbook multiplication.

# Finite linear network with roles and frames

A *finite linear network with roles and frames* is a fixed wiring of linear steps that exchanges two banks of values with prescribed signs and restores every auxiliary value it uses. Each fixed-tape procedure of the argument comes from one such network, and this page explains how a network computes its result on an array.

A wire's fixed place in the network is its *role*. Let $W$ be the number of roles. A *scratch* (auxiliary) role carries working values whose initial contents are arbitrary; the other roles carry the exchanged values.

The *scalar network* is the same wiring with each gate applied pointwise to matching addresses, so it acts on roles alone. Let $\rho$ be the permutation of roles that it applies: an input at role $w$ leaves at output role $\rho(w)$ with sign $\varepsilon_w \in \{+1,-1\}$.

To run the network on an array, regard a row as the complete ordered suffix of the array's address, at a fixed prefix and row index. These rows are the suffixes of [Address fields and array layout on tapes](address-fields.md), so the network acts on rows indexed by those fields. Distribute the rows cyclically: row $\ell$, the $\ell$th row at a fixed prefix, goes to role $\ell \bmod W$, after the row count for each prefix is padded to a multiple of $W$. Let $V$ be the number of bits stored after padding. Each role stream then holds $V/W$ bits (cited).

Each source, gate and sink $\nu$ carries an invertible linear operator $D_\nu$ on arrays indexed by the common address set, its *frame*. The stored array at $\nu$ is $D_\nu f$ when the logical array is $f$. A frame acts on addresses within one wire's array and never mixes wires. Along an edge from node $\alpha$ to node $\beta$ the stored array changes by $D_\beta D_\alpha^{-1}$.

A pointwise linear gate $G$ combines its $p$ input arrays $f_1,\dots,f_p$ at each address with fixed scalar coefficients. The frame $D_\nu$ of the gate is linear and the coefficients are scalars, so $$G(D_\nu f_1,\ldots,D_\nu f_p)=D_\nu G(f_1,\ldots,f_p).$$ Frames therefore pass through gates.

Along a route $\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k$ of edges, the operators telescope: $(D_{\alpha_k}D_{\alpha_{k-1}}^{-1})\cdots(D_{\alpha_1}D_{\alpha_0}^{-1})=D_{\alpha_k}D_{\alpha_0}^{-1}$. The intermediate frames cancel and the route applies only its endpoint operator.

Take an input role $w$ and its route to output role $\rho(w)$, carrying sign $\varepsilon_w \in \{+1,-1\}$. By the telescoping, the route applies $\varepsilon_w D_{\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))}D_{\mathrm{source}(w)}^{-1}$, where $\mathrm{source}(w)$ and $\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))$ are the first and last nodes of that route. Undoing the exchange moves each output back to its input role, and multiplying by $\varepsilon_w$ again removes the sign. For a scratch role the construction has $\rho(w)=w$ with sign $+1$ (cited), so the undoing needs no correction there. Every role keeps the endpoint operator (cited), auxiliary roles included.

Here $I$ is the identity operator, which leaves every array unchanged. For example, if a route has source frame $I$ and sink frame $D_\nu$, its operator is $D_\nu$, however many gates it passes through.
