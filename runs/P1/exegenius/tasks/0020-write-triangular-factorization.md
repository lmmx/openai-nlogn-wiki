# exegenius task 0020-write-triangular-factorization

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Lower triangular factorization and matrix shear cost
Gloss: Every rational matrix factors as E₁ΠE₂ with E₁, E₂ lower triangular and Π a partial permutation with rank-many ones, so a shear by A costs rank(A) interchanges plus linear work.

## This page in the argument

The step: Every rational matrix $A$ of rank $a$ factors as $E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ lower triangular and $\Pi$ a partial permutation with $a$ ones, so the shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ costs exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields plus $O(V)$ work.
How: Factor $A=E_1\Pi E_2$ by pivoting from the top row with lower triangular elimination, then conjugate the elementary shear $H_i\gets H_i+D_j$ for each one of $\Pi$ by triangular controlled shifts.
Why: Lower triangular changes of coordinates update a later field from earlier fields, which controlled shifts do in linear time, so all the cost is concentrated in the rank-many ones of $\Pi$. (the sources say so: "can be performed entirely in this direction." (paper))
Striking feature: The cost of a shear is the rank $a$ of its matrix, in interchanges, not the dimension $m$: each pivot one of $\Pi$ costs one interchange and everything else is linear. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ is $E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ having exactly $a$ ones, at most one per row and column.
- The shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ is performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields, each between an $H$ field and a $D$ field, and $O(V)$ further work.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time, with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Split the integers into radix digits, compute the digit convolution with synthetic transforms whose data movement and butterfly arithmetic are accelerated by two new tape procedures, and recover the exact product by rounding and carries. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](integer-multiplication-below-nlogn.md))
- Two tape procedures exist: interchanging two $u$-bit address chunks of an array of volume $V$ in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time with $\tau<1$, and applying $H_0$ at one bit position in each of $D\le d$ address chunks in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with $\lambda'<1$.; how: Build one fixed linear network per procedure that exchanges two banks of values with signs while restoring all scratch wires, label it with nested subspaces so that the sum $s$ of edge ranks is below $Wm$, and recurse on the edges.
- Two disjoint $u$-bit address chunks of an array of volume $V$ can be interchanged on a fixed number of tapes in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time, for a fixed rational $\tau<1$, with an exact permutation as final effect for arbitrary scratch contents.; how: Run the bit network on role streams so that its endpoint operator is the shear $H\gets H+D$, implement each edge shear by rank-many smaller interchanges, compose three shears into an interchange, solve the resulting recurrence, and then lift the width and row restrictions. (on [Fast address-chunk interchange](address-chunk-interchange.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S3.1.1, S3.1.2). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S3.1.1**: Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ is $E_1\Pi E_2$ with $E_1,E_2$ invertible lower triangular and $\Pi$ having exactly $a$ ones, at most one per row and column.
Source: "Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[Lower triangular factorization] \label{lem:lower-lower} Every rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ has a factorization \[ A=E_1\Pi E_2, \] where $E_1,E_2$ are invertible lower triangular rational matrices and $\Pi$ has exactly $a$ entries equal to one, with at most one in each row and column, and all remaining entries zero. \end{lemma}

**S3.1.2**: The shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$ is performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of $b$-digit fields, each between an $H$ field and a $D$ field, and $O(V)$ further work.
Source: "can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[The cost of a rational matrix shear] \label{lem:matrix-shear} Let $\mathcal A$ be a fixed finite collection of rational $m\times m$ matrices. There is a fixed odd prime $q$ such that the following holds. Let $H=(H_1,\ldots,H_m)$ and $D=(D_1,\ldots,D_m)$ be two ordered groups of fields, every field ranging over $[q^b]$, with every $H_i$ before every $D_j$. For $A\in\mathcal A$ of rational rank $a$, the permutation \[ (H,D)\longmapsto(H+AD,D) \quad\text{over }\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z \] can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work. Every interchange is between an $H$ field and a $D$ field. Spectators between any of the formal fields are allowed. \end{lemma}

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0020-write-triangular-factorization.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0020-write-triangular-factorization.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0020-write-triangular-factorization` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0020-write-triangular-factorization`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
