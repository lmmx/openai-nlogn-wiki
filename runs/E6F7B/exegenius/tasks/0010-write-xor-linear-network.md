Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F7B` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, functions, permutations, modular arithmetic, primes and gcd), calculus-level analysis (limits, sums, Newton's method), first-course linear algebra (matrices, inverses, Gaussian elimination, vectors) and complex numbers up to roots of unity, algorithm analysis (recursion, recurrences, big-O with its relatives Omega, Theta, little-o) and basic Turing machines.

Concept: Linear network exchanging two banks with restored scratch values
Gloss: A fixed network of pointwise linear gates on wires (data banks X, Y, scratch and central wires) that in three stages maps (X,Y) to (−Y,X) and returns every scratch wire to its arbitrary initial value, as in transparent computation.

## This page in the argument

The step: A fixed network of pointwise linear gates exchanges two banks, sending $(X,Y)$ to $(-Y,X)$, and returns every scratch wire to its arbitrary initial value.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Keep the transform-based multiplication of Harvey and van der Hoeven (Gaussian resampling, Bluestein chirp, synthetic polynomial transforms) but replace its two costly tape operations, address rearrangement and butterfly layers, by faster procedures obtained from rank-saving linear networks, then check exactness and total cost. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ for interchanging two address fields of $u$ bits and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a butterfly layer on at most $d$ chunks, where $V$ is the stored bit volume, $\tau<1$ and $\lambda'<1$.; how: Derive both procedures from the same device: a fixed linear network whose edge changes are cheaper smaller calls of the same procedure, on top of elementary linear-time stream operations.
- Fixed linear networks that exchange two banks of values and restore all scratch values, with a change of representation (frame) along each edge, have total edge rank $s<Wm$ and therefore give a recursion with exponent $\tau<1$.; how: Build a three-stage bank-exchange network, run it on arrays by choosing a frame at every vertex, label the vertices by nested subspaces of an $m$-dimensional space so that edge changes are small residuals, count the total edge rank, and feed the count into the recurrence.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Subspaces, orthogonality and rank](linear-algebra-prelims.md): Vector subspaces over the rationals or over the two-element field, bilinear forms, orthogonal complements, nondegeneracy, projections, matrix rank and tensor products.
  Shown as: Linear network exchanging two banks with restored scratch values *<predicate>* Subspaces, orthogonality and rank

## Pages that build on this one

- Subspace labels from three-element subsets: Frankl–Wilson style construction: indicator vectors of three-element subsets of [100] give intersection-size inner products; tensor cubes of these lines label gates by nested nondegenerate subspaces so that edge changes are small orthogonal residuals.
- Frames: changing the representation along a network: An invertible operator D_v on an array chosen at each source, gate and sink; every edge applies D_vD_u^{-1}, a common frame commutes with the pointwise linear gate, so the network implements D_out S D_in^{-1} and the endpoint frames fix the operator on every role.
- Complex phase network and two-point kernels: The same network over Gaussian dyadic values with binary labels and phase frames C_U = H^{⊗m} diag(i^{wt(P_U x) mod 4}) H^{⊗m}; each edge change is a product of two-point kernels C = aI+bX (a=(1+i)/2, b=(1−i)/2), and telescoping gives C^{⊗m} on every role with s_c < W_c·m kernel factors.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Each procedure arises from its own fixed linear network that exchanges two" (paper)

  > Each procedure arises from its own fixed linear network that exchanges two banks of values, with prescribed signs, and restores every auxiliary value. A wire's fixed place in the network is called its role. To use the network on an array, regard a row as the complete ordered suffix, including all active address fields, at a fixed prefix and row index. Distribute rows cyclically among the $W$ roles, padding the row count for each prefix to a multiple of $W$. Let $V$ now denote the node volume after padding. All role streams have the same local address set and each contains $V/W$ bits. A scalar gate is then applied pointwise to matching addresses on the roles that it touches.

- "(X_a,Y_a)\longmapsto(-Y_a,X_a)" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}\label{lem:scalar-motifs} For arbitrary initial values of its auxiliary wires, a forward invocation changes $y_S$ to $y_S+x_S$ and leaves every other value unchanged. Performing a forward invocation from $X$ to $Y$ at stage 1, the inverse forward schedule from $Y$ to $X$ at stage 2, and a forward invocation from $X$ to $Y$ at stage 3 sends \[ (X_a,Y_a)\longmapsto(-Y_a,X_a) \] and restores every auxiliary value. In the bit construction this is the permutation exchanging $X_a$ and $Y_a$. \end{lemma}

- "This cancellation of arbitrary initial scratch values is a linear" (paper)

  > um_{T\ni i}x_T$ to $C_i$, and the scatter adds $\sum_{i\in S}C_i$ to $y_S$. \item In the complex construction, scalars lie in $\mathbb Z[i,1/2]$, and neighbors are distinct triples with even intersection. Copy is unchanged. Side injection adds \[ -\sum_{T\text{ neighboring }S}\frac{|S\cap T|-1}{2}A_{ST} \] to $y_S$. Gather adds $\sum_{T\ni i}x_T$ to $C_i$ and $\sum_Tx_T$ to $C_\ast$. Scatter adds $(\sum_{i\in S}C_i-C_\ast)/2$ to $y_S$. \end{itemize} Each update leaves its control wires unchanged. The first two rows of the following schedule remove the effect of the old scratch values; the next four introduce the source values and add their effect to the target; the last two restore the scratch values. This cancellation of arbitrary initial scratch values is a linear instance of the restoration construction for transparent computation in Buhrman, Cleve, Kouck\'y, Loff and Speelman~\cite[Section~3]{BuhrmanCleveKouckyLoffSpeelman2014}. The forward schedule is \begin{equation} \begin{array}{c|l|l} \text{row}&\text{operation}&\text{gate grouping}\\ \hline 0&\text{subtract side injection}&\text{one gate per target}\\ 1&\text{subtract scatter}&\text{one gate on targets and center}\\ 2&\text{copy}&\text{one gate per source}\\ 3&\text{gather}&\text{one gate on sources and center}\\ 4&\text{scatter}&\text{one gate on targets and center}\\ 5&\text{side injection}&\text{one gate per target}\\ 6&\text{undo gather}&\text{one gate on sources and center}\\ 7&\text{undo copy}&\text{one

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-xor-linear-network.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-xor-linear-network.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0010-write-xor-linear-network` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0010-write-xor-linear-network`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
