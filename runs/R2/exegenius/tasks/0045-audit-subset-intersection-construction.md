# exegenius task 0045-audit-subset-intersection-construction

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows the concepts listed as known, and everything the reader profile covers: what anyone with that background has been taught, whether or not the profile names it (a profile of undergraduate computer science covers logarithms and proof by induction without naming them). Anything outside that, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: report what would stop this reader at this point on the page. A term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. A claim marked "(cited)" is attributed to the source. A citation lets the reader check a result, not follow an argument: a cited result the page uses is followable if the page says what it states and why it applies where it is used, and its proof can be left to the source. A cited claim that stands in for how the page's own concept works, or whose content or role the page does not say, is a step.
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links. References to the documents themselves (the paper, the sources, the target result) are not terms.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim that the page presents as following from what it gives, which the reader cannot check from what the page gives. A claim about an identity, construction or definition that the page never states is a step.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

## Reader profile

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has finished an undergraduate computer science degree: asymptotic analysis, discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes, binary representation, induction), introductory linear algebra (vectors, matrices, inverses, dot products), and the calculus the degree requires (limits, convergence of sequences and series, basic integrals). They know basic Turing machines with several tapes and standard algorithm analysis, including recurrences and schoolbook multiplication. They have not studied the FFT-based multiplication literature, abstract algebra beyond basics, or tape-level data-movement algorithms.

# Three-element subset intersection construction

The three-element subset intersection construction is a fixed finite network, built from gather, scatter and auxiliary wires, whose number of smaller calls is small enough for the recursion to save a power.

The construction is built inside a [Finite linear network with roles and frames](linear-network-roles.md). It uses three-element subsets of a fixed finite set. Gather and scatter operations, which combine several wires into one or spread one wire over several, create coefficients that depend on the size of the intersection of two such subsets. Auxiliary wires, which hold temporary values, cancel the coefficients that are not wanted.

The subsets also determine where subspaces go. Index the positions by the elements of the set. The indicator vector of a subset $A$ has entry $1$ at each element of $A$ and entry $0$ elsewhere. The dot product of two indicator vectors is the size of the intersection of their subsets, so the vectors for disjoint subsets are orthogonal. For example, $\{1,2,3\}$ and $\{4,5,6\}$ give orthogonal vectors, while $\{1,2,3\}$ and $\{3,4,5\}$ do not, since they share one element. Orthogonality of these vectors permits the assignment of subspaces to the gates and terminals.

Let $s$ be the total number of smaller calls, found by adding, over the edges of the network, the rank of the difference between the matrices assigned to the two ends of each edge. Let $W$ be the number of wires of the network, and let $m$ be the dimension of the fixed space that the subspaces lie in.

The network meets the count needed for the recursion. (cited) The recursion in [Recursive power saving from s<Wm](recursive-power-saving.md) uses this inequality to save a fixed power.
