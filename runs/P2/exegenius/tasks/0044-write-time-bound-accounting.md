# exegenius task 0044-write-time-bound-accounting

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Time-bound accounting and the exponent κ
Gloss: Dividing the costs of all stages by Tp = Θ(n) gives a table of normalized costs, each a power of p of at most 1 − 2κ (the minimum margin is 2^{−181} = 2κ with κ = 2^{−182}), so the total is O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}).

## This page in the argument

The step: Dividing the costs of all stages by $Tp=\Theta(n)$ gives normalized costs that are powers of $p$ at most $1-2\kappa$, so the total is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.
How: Tabulate the normalized cost of every stage as a power of $p$, compare each power with $1$ through an explicit margin, and absorb setup costs and fixed powers of $\log p$ into the slack
Why: A sum of costs each below $p^{1-2\kappa}$ (times a fixed number of logarithmic factors absorbed by the slack) is $O(p^{1-\kappa})$ per unit volume, so each stage's exponent only has to be compared with one. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The stages cost, per unit of $Tp$, $dK$, $pK^{\tau-1}$, $\ell d^{\lambda'}$, $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$, $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$, $dp^\delta$ and $\log(rp)$, which are powers of $p$ listed in a table.
- The seven dominant powers have margins $g_1,\dots,g_7$ below one, the smallest being $g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau)=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
- Setup, prime search, descriptor work and the compact sorting of exceptional addresses across all calls cost $o(Tp)$.
- Every dominant power is at most $1-2\kappa$ and a fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, so the cost is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers), run them inside synthetic transforms, reduce integer multiplication to such a convolution by resampling, chirps and a Chinese-remainder layout, then check precision and total up the time (on [Power-saving integer multiplication theorem](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S7.1, S7.2, S7.3, S7.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S7.1**: The stages cost, per unit of $Tp$, $dK$, $pK^{\tau-1}$, $\ell d^{\lambda'}$, $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$, $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$, $dp^\delta$ and $\log(rp)$, which are powers of $p$ listed in a table.
Source: "Table~\ref{tab:costs} lists costs after division" (paper)
> For the cost calculation put $V=Tp=\Theta(n)$. The fixed-width coefficient formats use $\Theta(p)$ bits per coefficient, so a full padded array has $\Theta(V)$ stored bits. Table~\ref{tab:costs} lists costs after division by $V$; a fixed number of repeated transforms and convolutions is included in its constants. \begin{table}[ht] \centering \small \begin{tabular}{@{}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{.40\linewidth}ll@{}} \toprule Operation & Normalized cost & Power of $p$\\ \midrule Prefix-slot moves and individual butterfly rounds & $dK$ & $\epsilon(1+c)$\\ Chunk exchanges for transform layout & $pK^{\tau-1}$ & $1-\epsilon c(1-\tau)$\\ Simultaneous butterfly rounds & $\ell d^{\lambda'}$ & $1-\epsilon(1-\lambda')$\\ CRT and axis layouts & $d^2(1+\ell^\tau)$ & $\tau+\epsilon(2-\tau)$\\ Gaussian line maps & $dp^{1/2+\delta}\alpha$ & $3/4+\delta+3\epsilon/2$\\ Chirps, twists and scalar products & $dp^\delta$ & $\epsilon+\delta$\\ Packed polynomial products & $\log(rp)$ & $1-\epsilon$\\ Final scaling and rounding & $p^\delta$ & absorbed above\\ Input, padding, carries and output & $1$ & absorbed above\\ \bottomrule \end{tabular} \caption{Costs divided by $Tp$; each coefficient representation has $O(p)$ bits.}\label{tab:costs} \end{table}

**S7.2**: The seven dominant powers have margins $g_1,\dots,g_7$ below one, the smallest being $g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau)=2^{-181}=2\kappa$.
Source: "Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$." (paper)
> The seven dominant powers in Table~\ref{tab:costs} have the following margins below one: \begin{equation}\label{eq:margin-list} \begin{split} g_1&=1-\epsilon(1+c),\qquad g_2=\epsilon c(1-\tau),\qquad g_3=\epsilon(1-\lambda'),\\ g_4&=1-\tau-\epsilon(2-\tau),\qquad g_5=1/4-\delta-3\epsilon/2,\\ g_6&=1-\delta-\epsilon,\qquad g_7=\epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation} Direct substitution gives \[ g_1>\frac12,\quad g_2=2^{-181},\quad g_3=2^{-129},\quad g_4>2^{-51},\quad g_5>\frac18,\quad g_6>\frac12,\quad g_7=2^{-75}. \] Thus $\min_i g_i=2^{-181}=2\kappa$. This explicit slack will cover any remaining fixed power of $\log p$.

**S7.3**: Setup, prime search, descriptor work and the compact sorting of exceptional addresses across all calls cost $o(Tp)$.
Source: "\paragraph{Setup and exceptional streams across all calls.}" (paper)
> \paragraph{Setup and exceptional streams across all calls.} We next separate setup at recursion nodes from work repeated for every polynomial record or every Gaussian line. Here a visit means a node of the layer or address-layout recursions, or one of their round and group invocations. The internal recursion of the established integer multiplier and the iterations of the quoted Gaussian algorithms are already included in their separately charged running times. The layer and address-layout recursions have constant branching and depth $O(\log p)$, and the number of their rounds and base-$m$ groups is polynomial in $p$. Choose a fixed exponent $A$ so that their total number of visits is at most $p^A$, and a fixed $C$ bounding descriptor setup performed once per visit by $p^C$ steps. This setup then costs at most $p^{A+C}=o(Tp)$.

**S7.4**: Every dominant power is at most $1-2\kappa$ and a fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually, so the cost is $O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})$.
Source: "O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa})." (paper)
> Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by \eqref{eq:margin-list}. Any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually. The complete large-input bound is consequently \[ O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}). \] Fix one cutoff beyond all the size, precision, margin and layout conditions, and use schoolbook multiplication below it. The finitely many smaller lengths are included by enlarging the implicit constant. With $\lg n=\max\{\lceil\log_2n\rceil,1\}$, the resulting single fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape deterministic machine has worst-case time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every input length and produces precisely the required $2n$-bit product. \section{Exact division and integer square root} \label{sec:exact-arithmetic-proof}

- Power-saving integer multiplication theorem: One deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies n-bit integers exactly in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) worst-case time with κ = 2^{−182}, disproving the n log n optimality conjecture in this model; it combines fast address interchange, fast simultaneous butterfly layers, and the resampling–chirp–synthetic-convolution reduction.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0044-write-time-bound-accounting.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0044-write-time-bound-accounting.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0044-write-time-bound-accounting` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0044-write-time-bound-accounting`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
