# exegenius task 0048-write-tensor-resampling

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Tensor interface for resampling
Gloss: The resampling identity is applied along each of d axes (lines) of a padded power-of-two box, with axes exposed and restored by chunk interchanges; total cost O(dTp^{3/2+δ}α) for the line maps plus O(Tp d²(1+ℓ^τ)) for data movement.

## This page in the argument

The step: Applying the resampling identity along each of $d$ axes of a padded power-of-two box gives $R F_{\boldsymbol s}=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0 QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A$ with line-map cost $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ and data movement $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$.
How: Tensor the one-dimensional identity, expand and compress one axis at a time on lines whose other coordinates are valid, and expose and restore each axis by adjacent chunk interchanges.
Why: The one-dimensional maps act on a single coordinate line, so the axes must be brought to the innermost address field one at a time, and the chunk interchange supplies that movement. (the sources say so: "line at a time. The chunk-swap algorithm supplies the movement of the" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Tensoring the one-dimensional identity proves the identity for $d$ axes, and the box is expanded by padding with zeros outside the valid source coordinates.
- Moving an axis past its neighbor is an interchange of equal-width address fields (after peeling one extra bit), costing $O(Tp(1+\ell^\tau))$, and $O(d^2)$ of them expose and restore all axes.
- At most $2dT/r$ lines are processed, so per-line setup of fixed polynomial degree in $p$ is $o(Tp)$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Reduce multiplication to convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ through radix digits, Chinese-remainder axes, Gaussian resampling and chirps, speed up the data movement and the butterfly arithmetic with two network-based tape procedures with a strict rank saving, recover the exact product by rounding and carries, and add up the costs. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Fourier transforms of pairwise coprime lengths $s_i$ can be replaced by transforms of power-of-two lengths $t_i$ using Gaussian resampling, with the source and target permutations retained in the identity and the middle transform computed as a chirp convolution.; how: Apply Gaussian resampling along each axis with both coordinate permutations kept inside the transform identity, evaluate the middle transform by Bluestein's chirp as a cyclic convolution, and cancel the source permutation across the convolution.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (I2.1, I2.2, I2.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**I2.1**: Tensoring the one-dimensional identity proves the identity for $d$ axes, and the box is expanded by padding with zeros outside the valid source coordinates.
Source: "Tensoring \eqref{eq:no-sort-one-dimensional} proves" (paper)
> \begin{proof} Tensoring \eqref{eq:no-sort-one-dimensional} proves \eqref{eq:no-sort-tensor}. To implement $\mathcal A$, first embed its input in the padded box by writing zero outside $\prod_i[0,s_i)$. Expand the axes one at a time. After the axes in a set $I$ have been expanded, the valid entries have coordinate ranges $[0,t_i)$ for $i\in I$ and $[0,s_i)$ otherwise; every other entry is zero. Expose the next axis $i$ as the innermost address field. On a line whose other coordinates are valid, read its first $s_i$ values and apply $\widetilde A_i$, then write the resulting $t_i$ values. On every other line write $t_i$ zeros. The new valid set is the one for $I\cup\{i\}$.

**I2.2**: Moving an axis past its neighbor is an interchange of equal-width address fields (after peeling one extra bit), costing $O(Tp(1+\ell^\tau))$, and $O(d^2)$ of them expose and restore all axes.
Source: "To move an axis past its neighbor, interchange their" (paper)
> The descriptor records which coordinate each physical address field holds. Thus moving fields changes their positions, but not the validity conditions above. To move an axis past its neighbor, interchange their $\ell$-bit or $(\ell-1)$-bit address fields. Equal widths use Lemma~\ref{lem:chunk-swap}. For unequal widths, write the longer field as a leading bit $e$ followed by $\ell-1$ bits. If it comes first, the order is $e\,x\,y$, with $x,y$ of equal width. Interchange $x,y$, then move $e$ between them, obtaining $y\,e\,x$. If the longer field comes second, first move its leading bit left of the shorter field, then interchange the two equal-width pieces. The bit move uses Lemma~\ref{lem:elementary-streams}. Each adjacent interchange therefore costs $O(Tp(1+\ell^\tau))$. Exposing and restoring one axis needs $O(d)$ adjacent interchanges, hence all axes need $O(d^2)$. These are exact permutations of the padded box, so they change neither norms nor errors.

**I2.3**: At most $2dT/r$ lines are processed, so per-line setup of fixed polynomial degree in $p$ is $o(Tp)$.
Source: "Since $t_i\geq r/2$, each tensor map invokes at most" (paper)
> Since $t_i\geq r/2$, each tensor map invokes at most $\sum_iT/t_i\leq2dT/r$ lines. For any fixed setup degree $c$, work $O(p^c)$ per line totals $O(dTp^c/r)=o(Tp)$: after division by $Tp$, the ratio is $O(dp^{c-1}/r)$, which tends to zero under the stated growth assumptions. This estimate includes local descriptor copying, validity tests per line, and preparing line boundaries. \end{proof}

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Gaussian resampling with retained permutations](gaussian-resampling.md): Harvey–van der Hoeven resampling replaces a Fourier transform of coprime length s by one of length t (a power of two) using Gaussian-weighted maps A and B₀; here the two coordinate permutations stay in the identity P_s F_s = 2^{2α²} B₀ P_t F_t A instead of being executed as sorts.

  Shown as: Tensor interface for resampling *<predicate>* Multidimensional transform and cyclic convolution on a product of axes
- [Fast address-chunk interchange](chunk-swap.md): Arbitrary-width interchange of two disjoint address chunks of u bits in O(V u^τ) with fixed τ<1: peel off top digits to supply rows, pad rows, decompose the rest in base m and apply the power-width interchange to each piece.

- [Arrays, address fields, rows and logical volume](address-fields-volume.md): Arrays on a product of ranges [a₁]×…×[a_t] are stored in lexicographic order with implicit addresses; V is the number of stored bits, and a row is the full block at a fixed prefix and row index.

## Pages that build on this one

- Source transform procedure: The computed transform of a prime-axes source array: expand axes by A, apply the chirp transform on power-of-two axes, compress with B₀, and scale by 2^γ; its exact counterpart is R F_s, and the opposite-sign version is obtained by conjugation.
- Cost analysis and the exponent κ: Dividing all costs by Tp = Θ(n) gives a table of seven dominant terms whose powers of p are all at most 1 − 2κ for κ = 2^{−182}, so the total is O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) with schoolbook multiplication for small inputs.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "RF_{\boldsymbol s}
   =2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A," (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Tensor interface] \label{lem:tensor-resampling} Suppose every pair $(s_i,t_i)$, $1\leq i\leq d$, satisfies Lemma~\ref{lem:no-sort-resampling} with the same $p,\alpha,\delta$. Put $T=\prod_i t_i$, $\gamma=2d\alpha^2$, and \[ R=\bigotimes_iP_{s_i},\quad Q=\bigotimes_iP_{t_i},\quad \mathcal A=\bigotimes_i A_i,\quad \mathcal B_0=\bigotimes_i B_{0,i}. \] Then \begin{equation} RF_{\boldsymbol s} =2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A, \qquad F_{\boldsymbol q}:=\bigotimes_iF_{q_i}. \label{eq:no-sort-tensor} \end{equation} Also write $F_{\boldsymbol q}^+=\bigotimes_iF_{q_i}^+$. Both $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B_0$ are contractions. The linewise implementations of $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B_0$ each have error less than $dp^2$. The total time spent in the one-dimensional algorithms for both maps is $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$, with a constant independent of $d$.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0048-write-tensor-resampling.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0048-write-tensor-resampling.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0048-write-tensor-resampling` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0048-write-tensor-resampling`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
