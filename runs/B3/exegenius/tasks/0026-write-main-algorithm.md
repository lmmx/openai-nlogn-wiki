# exegenius task 0026-write-main-algorithm

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/B3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Multiplication algorithm and its cost
Gloss: Chain the reductions: digits, prime axes, resampling and chirps, phase twist, ring convolution with fast interchanges and butterfly layers, then rescaling, rounding and carries; the cost table fits n(lg n)^(1−κ).

## This page in the argument

The step: Chaining the reductions from integer multiplication to ring convolution, with exact recovery, multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.
How: reduce digit convolution step by step to ring convolution, then recover the integer and add up costs
Why: Figure in the introduction summarizes these reductions as changes of problem and representation, each cheap or already solved. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Splitting both inputs into radix-$2^b$ digits turns the product into a convolution of short integer coefficients, followed by carries. (on [Multiplication as digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md))
- A Chinese-remainder address map places the coefficient list on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes preserving convolution. (on [Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes](crt-prime-axes.md))
- Gaussian resampling gives $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$ expressing a transform on coprime lengths through a transform with power-of-two lengths, keeping the permutations. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- Bluestein's chirp identity turns the transform with its target permutation into a cyclic convolution, and the retained source permutation cancels across forward and opposite transforms. (on [Bluestein chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md))
- The twist $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ turns cyclic convolution of length $r$ into convolution modulo $y^r+1$, whose negative wrap gives the cyclic wrap after untwisting. (on [Coefficient twist to the polynomial ring](phase-twist.md))
- The algorithm chains digit extraction, address map, source transforms, pointwise product, opposite transform, rescaling, rounding and carry propagation.
- With Gaussian dyadic intermediates and one truncation per contractive layer the accumulated error stays strictly below $1/2$, so rounding and carries give the exact product. (on [Fixed-point precision and exact recovery](fixed-point-precision.md))
- Each normalized cost in the table has power of $p$ at most $1-2\kappa$, so the total time is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A fixed deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two fast tape procedures, use them in synthetic transforms for ring convolution, then chain the reductions from integer multiplication (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-result.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S4.6, S4.8). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S4.6**: The algorithm chains digit extraction, address map, source transforms, pointwise product, opposite transform, rescaling, rounding and carry propagation.
Source: "The source-transform procedures now supply the three transforms needed" (paper)
> The source-transform procedures now supply the three transforms needed for the radix-digit convolution. Read each stored operand backward from its least significant end in groups of $b$ bits. This produces the radix-$2^b$ digits $a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}$ in increasing coefficient order. Buffer each group on a fixed work tape and read it back most significant bit first, reversing its least-significant-first input order; pad the final short group with leading zeroes. For digit $a_j$, write the exact grid numerator $a_j2^{p-b-2}$ in a signed $w_{\rm c}$-bit real word, followed by a zero $w_{\rm c}$-bit imaginary word. This exponent is nonnegative because $p=6b$, and the represented value is exactly $a_j2^{-b-2}$. Append $S-q$ zero coefficient records. Buffering and ordering the groups costs $O(n)$, including the one partial group's padding, and writing the $S$ records costs $O(Sp)$. Together with the initial count and copies, this input conversion costs $O(n+Sp)=O(Tp)$; all $n$ input bits, including leading zeroes, are retained before the final group is padded.

**S4.8**: Each normalized cost in the table has power of $p$ at most $1-2\kappa$, so the total time is $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$.
Source: "Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by" (paper)
> Each of the seven displayed powers is at most $1-2\kappa$ by \eqref{eq:margin-list}. Any fixed power of $\log p$ is at most $p^\kappa$ eventually. The complete large-input bound is consequently \[ O(Tp\,p^{1-\kappa})=O(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}). \] Fix one cutoff beyond all the size, precision, margin and layout conditions, and use schoolbook multiplication below it. The finitely many smaller lengths are included by enlarging the implicit constant. With $\lg n=\max\{\lceil\log_2n\rceil,1\}$, the resulting single fixed-alphabet, fixed-tape deterministic machine has worst-case time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for every input length and produces precisely the required $2n$-bit product. \section{Exact division and integer square root} \label{sec:exact-arithmetic-proof}

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S4.2 (on [Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes](crt-prime-axes.md)): A Chinese-remainder address map places the coefficient list on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes preserving convolution.
- S4.3 (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md)): Gaussian resampling gives $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$ expressing a transform on coprime lengths through a transform with power-of-two lengths, keeping the permutations.
- S4.4 (on [Bluestein chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md)): Bluestein's chirp identity turns the transform with its target permutation into a cyclic convolution, and the retained source permutation cancels across forward and opposite transforms.
- S4.5 (on [Coefficient twist to the polynomial ring](phase-twist.md)): The twist $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ turns cyclic convolution of length $r$ into convolution modulo $y^r+1$, whose negative wrap gives the cyclic wrap after untwisting.
