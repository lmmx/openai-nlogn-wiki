# exegenius task 0036-write-exact-recovery

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/O2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: discrete mathematics (sets, induction, modular arithmetic, gcd, primes, the Chinese remainder theorem, binary representation and XOR), a first linear algebra course (vector spaces, matrices, rank, Gaussian elimination, eigenvalues, mostly over the reals but with arithmetic mod 2 seen in discrete math), single-variable calculus (limits, exponentials and logarithms, geometric series, simple inequalities, Newton's method), and an algorithms and theory sequence (asymptotic notation, recurrences, sorting, binary search, Turing machines and time complexity, schoolbook multiplication with carries). They have not studied fast Fourier transform based multiplication, the Schönhage–Strassen/Harvey–van der Hoeven line of work, polynomial transforms over quotient rings, tensor products, bilinear forms over finite fields, or the extremal set-theory constructions the paper borrows; those are what the wiki explains.

## This page

Concept: Exact recovery by rounding and carries
Gloss: Removing known normalizations and digit scales, bounding the total coefficient error strictly below 1/2 so rounding recovers the exact integer convolution, then propagating radix-2^b carries to output the 2n-bit product.
Also called: precision and exact recovery

## This page in the argument

The step: The final absolute coefficient error is below $1/2$, so rounding gives the exact integer coefficients, and radix-$2^b$ carries give the $2n$-bit product.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine computes the exact $2n$-bit product of two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: build two linear-network tape procedures, fast address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers, from fixed networks with a strict rank saving; use them in synthetic transforms; place these in the Harvey–van der Hoeven reduction through radix digits, a CRT map, Gaussian resampling with retained permutations, Bluestein chirps and a phase twist; and bound every cost term (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The $2n$-bit product is the carried radix-$2^b$ digit list of $2^{2b+4}S\,w$, where $w=(u*v)/S$ is computed from the source transforms of the CRT-mapped digit arrays $u,v$ with final error below $1/2$.; how: map the radix digits by the CRT address map, compute two forward source transforms by resampling, chirps and twisted synthetic convolution, multiply pointwise, apply the opposite transform, rescale, round and propagate carries

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Disk-grid approximation and error accounting](error-accounting.md): Each routine approximates a linear contraction on the p-bit disk grid with an error bound in units of 2^−p, and composed errors add because contractions do not amplify input errors.
  Shown as: Exact recovery by rounding and carries *<predicate>* Disk-grid approximation and error accounting
- [Multiplication by radix-digit convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md): Splitting each n-bit input into radix-2^b digits turns integer multiplication into convolution of short integer coefficient lists followed by carry propagation.
  Shown as: Exact recovery by rounding and carries *<predicate>* Multiplication by radix-digit convolution

## Pages that build on this one

- Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time: One deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine computes the exact 2n-bit product of two n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^{1−κ}) time with κ = 2^−182, via radix digits, a CRT map, Gaussian resampling with retained permutations, Bluestein chirps, a phase twist and synthetic transforms accelerated by fast interchanges and simultaneous butterfly layers, disproving the n log n conjecture in this model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "proves that the recovered
coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$, and propagates carries to
obtain the exact binary product." (paper)

  > Finally, the source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product, and the opposite-sign transform. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} removes the known normalizations and digit scales, proves that the recovered coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$, and propagates carries to obtain the exact binary product. A compatible choice of rational parameters makes all terms in its cost table fit Theorem~\ref{thm:main}. Figure~\ref{fig:multiplication-flow} summarizes these reductions.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0036-write-exact-recovery.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0036-write-exact-recovery.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0036-write-exact-recovery` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0036-write-exact-recovery`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
