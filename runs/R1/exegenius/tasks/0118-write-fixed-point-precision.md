# exegenius task 0118-write-fixed-point-precision

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Fixed-point precision and exact recovery
Gloss: Complex fixed-point coefficients; bounding error below 1/2 so rounding recovers exact integer coefficients and carry propagation yields the product.
Also called: source scale 2^gamma

## This page in the argument

The step: Known rescalings and rounding recover the coefficients since the error is below $1/2$, and carry propagation gives the exact product.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- An $n$-bit integer product is computed by a fixed-tape machine in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time, $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: reduce multiplication to ring convolution and speed up its address moves and butterfly layers (on [Integer multiplication in O(n(lg n)^{1-κ}) time](main-theorem.md))

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "proves that the recovered" (paper)

  > Finally, the source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product, and the opposite-sign transform. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} removes the known normalizations and digit scales, proves that the recovered coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$, and propagates carries to obtain the exact binary product. A compatible choice of rational parameters makes all terms in its cost table fit Theorem~\ref{thm:main}. Figure~\ref{fig:multiplication-flow} summarizes these reductions.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "$\mathcal F^{+}(\mathcal Fu\cdot\mathcal Fv)=(u*v)/S^2$" (The page does not define F^+ beyond calling it the opposite of the forward transform, and does not state what the cited chirp and permutation cancellation lemma says or why it applies here. The reader cannot check the identity.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step. It is inside reasoning added for an earlier step. If it is part of how this page's own step of the argument works (see "This page in the argument"), develop it here; if it concerns a result that step uses, say what the result states and cite it.

- "forward transform of length S" is the concept [Discrete Fourier transform and butterflies](dft-fft.md), now a prerequisite: link it where the term is used.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 331 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 413 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

Fixed-point precision and exact recovery is the step that turns approximate transform output into exact integers, and then into the digits of the product. It recovers the integer coefficients produced by the [Reduction of integer product to digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md).

Each complex coefficient is stored as a pair of integer numerators over $2^p$, where $p$ is the working precision in bits; a numerator $H$ represents $H/2^p$. Scalings by known factors are exact on numerators, so the only inexact steps are the transforms and truncations. The source takes $p=6b$.

Let $T$ be a power of two with $4n/b\le T<8n/b$, and let $S$ be the cyclic convolution length, with $T/2<S<T$. With $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ digits per input, the product has degree $2q-2<T/2<S$, so cyclic convolution has no wraparound. Each coefficient $c_j$, for $0\le j<S$, sums at most $q$ products of digits below $2^b$, so $0\le c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2<2^{3b}$, since $q\le n\le 2^b$.

Let $u$ and $v$ be the digit lists of the two inputs, each entry divided by $2^{b+2}$, so every entry has magnitude below $1/4$. Let $\mathcal F$ be the forward transform of length $S$ and $\mathcal F^{+}$ its opposite. The source's chirp and permutation cancellation lemma gives $\mathcal F^{+}(\mathcal Fu\cdot\mathcal Fv)=(u*v)/S^2$, where $\cdot$ is entrywise product and $*$ is cyclic convolution. Multiplying by $S$ and then by $2^{2b+4}S$ gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$, whose entries are the $c_j$.

Let $L=\log_2 T$, and let $\gamma$ be the exponent of the source scale $2^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma\le b/4$ for large $b$. Each transform, product and truncation adds error below a constant times $2^{-p}$ per entry. Tracking these through the transforms and the pointwise product, the computed array after multiplication by $S$ lies within $28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-p}$ of $(u*v)/S$. The final scaling by $2^{2b+4}S$ gives a coefficient error below $2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b}<448b\,2^{-b+\gamma}\le448b\,2^{-3b/4}$, using $S<T<2^b$, $L<b$ and $\gamma\le b/4$. For large $b$ this bound is below $\tfrac12$ <cite data-source="paper">448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12</cite>. So rounding each recovered value to the nearest integer returns $c_j$ exactly.

Carry propagation then gives the digits. Let $h_0=0$ and, for $0\le j<S$,
$$d_j=(c_j+h_j)\bmod 2^b,\qquad h_{j+1}=\left\lfloor\frac{c_j+h_j}{2^b}\right\rfloor.$$
Since $c_j+h_j=d_j+2^bh_{j+1}$, induction gives $\sum_{i<j}c_i2^{bi}=\sum_{i<j}d_i2^{bi}+h_j2^{bj}$. The final carry $h_S$ is zero: $2n<bS$, so $xy=\sum_{i<S}c_i2^{bi}<2^{2n}\le2^{bS}$, while the digit sum $\sum_{i<S}d_i2^{bi}$ is also below $2^{bS}$. Hence $d_0,\dots,d_{S-1}$ are the full radix-$2^b$ digits of the product.

Example, radix $10$ for $2^b$ and $c=(12,15,3)$:  $d_0=2$, $h_1=1$; $d_1=6$, $h_2=1$; $d_2=4$, $h_3=0$. The digits $4,6,2$ give $462=12+15\cdot10+3\cdot100$.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:
