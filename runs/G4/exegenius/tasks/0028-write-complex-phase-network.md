# exegenius task 0028-write-complex-phase-network

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G4` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has done an undergraduate computer science degree: discrete mathematics (modular arithmetic, primes and gcd, sets, induction, recurrences and asymptotics), basic linear algebra over the reals and complex numbers (matrices, inverses, norms), polynomials and complex roots of unity, and algorithms including divide and conquer and Karatsuba multiplication. On the machine side they know basic single- and multi-tape Turing machines and the idea of counting steps. They have not studied the Fourier transform, FFT-based multiplication, Schonhage-Strassen, Harvey-van der Hoeven, numerical error analysis, abstract algebra beyond rings of residues, finite-field linear algebra, or any lower-bound or advanced tape-algorithm technique, so those must be explained.

Concept: Complex phase network
Gloss: The complex-scalar version of the exchange network with binary labels whose phase frames i^{wt(Px)} reduce to translation kernels aI + bX_v, giving C^{⊗m} on every role with s_c < W_c m.

## This page in the argument

The step: In the complex network with binary labels, every edge's phase-frame difference is a product of translation kernels $aI+bX_v$, one per vector of an orthonormal basis of the edge residual, with total length $s_{\rm c}<W_{\rm c}m$, and the frames telescope to $C^{\otimes m}$ on every role.
How: Use the phase frames $i^{\operatorname{wt}(P_Ux)}$, whose weights add modulo 4 across orthogonal vectors, so each orthonormal residual vector contributes one two-point kernel; repair the single pair $X_a\to Y_a$ by conjugating with $Z$.
Why: Hamming weight is additive modulo 4 over orthogonal binary vectors, and an orthonormal basis of norm-one vectors makes each residual vector contribute exactly one kernel $aI+bX_v$ of the same form as the two-point kernel $C$. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: Whatever the network does inside, every role, including every scratch role, ends with exactly the same operator $C^{\otimes m}$; this uniformity comes from telescoping phase frames. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- A single orthonormal residual vector $v$ turns the phase $i^{\varepsilon[v\cdot x]}$ into a combination of the identity and the character $(-1)^{v\cdot x}$.
- After the Hadamard conjugation the character becomes the translation $X_v$, so the phase becomes $aI+bX_v$ or its inverse.
- The zero label has frame $I$ and the full label has frame $C^{\otimes m}$, so only the pair $X_a\to Y_a$ is not already a forward $C^{\otimes m}$.
- After $Z$ corrections and undoing the signed exchange, every role, scratch roles included, receives $C^{\otimes m}$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, disproving the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in that model.; how: Reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of radix digits evaluated by Fourier-type transforms, make the two costly ingredients of those transforms (address rearrangement and butterfly arithmetic) cost a power of the logarithm less than a full scan per level by two rank-saving tape procedures, then assemble the algorithm, prove exactness and total the cost. (on [Sub-n log n integer multiplication](sub-nlogn-multiplication.md))
- Two fixed linear networks, one over bits and one over complex numbers, exchange two banks of values, restore every scratch value, and have total edge rank $s$ below $Wm$, where $W$ is the number of wires and $m$ the label dimension.; how: Build a scalar bank-exchange network from three-element subset intersections, lift it to arrays through frames, attach nested subspace labels to its gates, and read off a rational interface for bits and a phase interface for complex values.

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1.4.1, S1.4.2, S1.4.3, S1.4.4). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1.4.1**: A single orthonormal residual vector $v$ turns the phase $i^{\varepsilon[v\cdot x]}$ into a combination of the identity and the character $(-1)^{v\cdot x}$.
Source: "$i^{\varepsilon[v\cdot x]}$ equals" (paper)
> \begin{proof} For binary vectors $z,w$, \[ \operatorname{wt}(z+w) =\operatorname{wt}(z)+\operatorname{wt}(w) -2|\operatorname{supp}(z)\cap\operatorname{supp}(w)|. \] If $z\cdot w=0$, the intersection cardinality is even, so weight is additive modulo four. If $V=U\mathbin{\perp}E$ and $\mathcal B$ is an orthonormal basis of $E$, it follows that \[ q_V(x)-q_U(x)=\sum_{v\in\mathcal B} \operatorname{wt}(v)[v\cdot x]\pmod4. \] For a decreasing edge the right side is negated. Each $v$ has norm one, so $\operatorname{wt}(v)$ is odd. Its coefficient in the phase, including the sign for the edge direction, is therefore some $\varepsilon\in\{1,-1\}$ modulo four. The function $i^{\varepsilon[v\cdot x]}$ equals \[ \frac{1+i^\varepsilon}{2} +\frac{1-i^\varepsilon}{2}(-1)^{v\cdot x}. \] The identity $H\operatorname{diag}(1,-1)H=X$, tensored over the coordinates in $\operatorname{supp}(v)$, sends the diagonal character $(-1)^{v\cdot x}$ to translation $X_v$. The displayed phase therefore becomes $aI+bX_v$ or its inverse. The nonzero residuals have such bases by Lemma~\ref{lem:motif-residuals}; for a zero residual use the empty basis. The same lemma gives the count $s_{\rm c}$. The deficit is $2N-2L_{\rm c}>0$.

**S1.4.2**: After the Hadamard conjugation the character becomes the translation $X_v$, so the phase becomes $aI+bX_v$ or its inverse.
Source: "becomes $aI+bX_v$ or its inverse." (paper)
> \begin{proof} For binary vectors $z,w$, \[ \operatorname{wt}(z+w) =\operatorname{wt}(z)+\operatorname{wt}(w) -2|\operatorname{supp}(z)\cap\operatorname{supp}(w)|. \] If $z\cdot w=0$, the intersection cardinality is even, so weight is additive modulo four. If $V=U\mathbin{\perp}E$ and $\mathcal B$ is an orthonormal basis of $E$, it follows that \[ q_V(x)-q_U(x)=\sum_{v\in\mathcal B} \operatorname{wt}(v)[v\cdot x]\pmod4. \] For a decreasing edge the right side is negated. Each $v$ has norm one, so $\operatorname{wt}(v)$ is odd. Its coefficient in the phase, including the sign for the edge direction, is therefore some $\varepsilon\in\{1,-1\}$ modulo four.

**S1.4.3**: The zero label has frame $I$ and the full label has frame $C^{\otimes m}$, so only the pair $X_a\to Y_a$ is not already a forward $C^{\otimes m}$.
Source: "The zero label has frame $I$, while the full label has frame" (paper)
> :scalar-motifs}, the pointwise scalar network sends an input array at $X_a$ to $Y_a$ with sign $+1$, an input at $Y_a$ to $X_a$ with sign $-1$, and each scratch input to its own output with sign $+1$. Applying \eqref{eq:common-frame-identity} with $D_v=\mathcal C_{U_v}$, where $U_v$ is the label at vertex $v$, shows that an input role $w$ reaches output role $\rho(w)$ with that sign and with operator $\mathcal C_{U_{\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))}} \mathcal C_{U_{\mathrm{source}(w)}}^{-1}$. For $k$ columns, use $D_v=\mathcal C_{U_v}^{\otimes k}$ on the joint address set in the same identity. The route operator is then the $k$th tensor power of the displayed address operator, multiplied by its scalar route sign once. The zero label has frame $I$, while the full label has frame $C^{\otimes m}$ because $q_{\mathcal F}(x)=\operatorname{wt}(x)$. Every pair except $X_a\to Y_a$ has these zero and full labels. For the remaining pair, write $u=u_a$. Its binary norm is one and its weight is $3^3=27$. Orthogonal weight additivity yields \begin{align*} q_{U_a^\perp}(x)-q_{U_a}(x) &=\operatorname{wt}(x)-2\operatorname{wt}(u)[u\cdot x]\\ &=\operatorname{wt}(x)+2[u\cdot x]\pmod4. \end{align*} Since $2[u\cdot x]\equiv2\sum_{j\in\operatorname{supp}(u)}x_j \pmod4$, the operator on $X_a\to Y_a$ is the tensor of $C^{-1}$ on the 27 coordinates of $\operatorname{supp}(u)$ and $C$ elsewhere. Put $Z=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1)$. Direct multiplication gives \[ C=iZC^{-1}Z,\qquad C^{-1}=-iZCZ. \] For $

> upp}(u)$ and $C$ elsewhere. Put $Z=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1)$. Direct multiplication gives \[ C=iZC^{-1}Z,\qquad C^{-1}=-iZCZ. \] For $k$ columns, let $Z_{a,k}$ be the tensor product of $Z$ on those 27 coordinates in every column and the identity elsewhere. Apply $Z_{a,k}$ before the network at $X_a$, and apply $i^{27k}Z_{a,k}$ after the network at $Y_a$; the latter scalar is applied once to the whole role. There are $27k$ inverse factors, so the identity $C=iZC^{-1}Z$ turns each of them into $C$. The operator on this pair is therefore $C^{\otimes mk}$ as well. Only the physical $X$ outputs still carry the minus sign of the scalar exchange. Negate those outputs and send output role $\rho(w)$ back to role $w$. Every role, including every scratch role, now has the required forward tensor product. \end{proof}

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "is a product of one translation
kernel $aI+bX_v$, or its inverse, per vector in an orthonormal basis" (paper)

  > \begin{proposition}\label{prop:complex-motif-interface} For each edge of the complex network, write $U,V$ for its tail and head labels. Its phase-frame difference $\mathcal C_V\mathcal C_U^{-1}$ is a product of one translation kernel $aI+bX_v$, or its inverse, per vector in an orthonormal basis of the edge residual. Here $(X_vf)(x)=f(x+v)$. The sum of these basis lengths is \[ s_{\rm c}=W_{\rm c}m-2N+2L_{\rm c} =1873807244636671267308000000<W_{\rm c}m. \] After source and sink diagonal corrections, and undoing the signed bank exchange, telescoping these phase frames gives $C^{\otimes m}$ on every role, including auxiliary roles. The same assertion holds on any positive number of columns by taking tensor products over columns. \end{proposition}

- "q_U(x)=\operatorname{wt}(P_Ux)\pmod4." (paper)

  > Use the complex scalar network and binary labels. For a binary vector $x$, let $\operatorname{wt}(x)$ denote its integer Hamming weight, and write $[b]\in\{0,1\}$ for the integer representative of $b\in\mathbb F_2$. For a label $U$, let \[ q_U(x)=\operatorname{wt}(P_Ux)\pmod4. \] The projection here is over $\mathbb F_2$. Let \[ H=\frac1{\sqrt2}\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix},\quad C=H\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&i\end{pmatrix}H =aI+bX,\qquad a=\frac{1+i}{2},\quad b=\frac{1-i}{2}, \] where $X$ interchanges the two coordinates. On functions of $x\in\mathbb F_2^m$ define \[ \mathcal C_U=H^{\otimes m}\operatorname{diag}_x(i^{q_U(x)})H^{\otimes m}. \] The use of $H$ in this definition is an identity of matrices. Each entry of $\mathcal C_U$ and its inverse is a Gaussian integer divided by $2^m$, so both preserve arrays over $\mathbb Z[i,1/2]$. The kernels implemented below have Gaussian dyadic coefficients.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0028-write-complex-phase-network.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0028-write-complex-phase-network.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0028-write-complex-phase-network` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0028-write-complex-phase-network`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
