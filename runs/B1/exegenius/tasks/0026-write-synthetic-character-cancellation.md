# exegenius task 0026-write-synthetic-character-cancellation

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/B1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Synthetic character cancellation
Gloss: In the ring modulo y^r+1, sums of powers of the root ω_t vanish unless t divides the exponent, so forward and opposite transforms invert each other up to 1/t.

## This page in the argument

The step: In the ring modulo $y^r+1$, sums of powers of $\omega_t$ vanish unless $t$ divides the exponent, so $F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I$.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- Integer multiplication of $n$-bit integers takes $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$ on one fixed multitape machine.; how: reduce to digit convolution, build the fast tape and ring-transform tools bottom up, then assemble reductions, precision and cost (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ is computed exactly by fast synthetic transforms, where $r$ is a power of two.; how: evaluate at powers of $y$ as roots of unity, where multiplication by a root is a signed shift, using the fast layers (on [Synthetic polynomial transform](synthetic-transform.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Synthetic polynomial transform](synthetic-transform.md): Fourier transform over the polynomial ring where powers of y act as roots of unity, so multiplying by a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list (Nussbaumer).
  Shown as: Synthetic character cancellation *<predicate>* Synthetic polynomial transform

## Pages that build on this one

- Normalized convolution over the ring: Convolution over the polynomial ring computed as two forward synthetic transforms, pointwise ring products by signed packing, and the opposite transform, normalized by 1/(rM).

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The ring has zero divisors, so we verify character cancellation" (paper)

  > For a power of two $t$ dividing $2r$, define $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$. For $z\in\mathcal R_r^t$ and $0\leq j<t$, set \[ (F_t^-z)_j=\frac1t\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{-jk}z_k, \qquad (F_t^+z)_j=\frac1t\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{jk}z_k. \] Every power of $\omega_t$ is an isometry, and each transform entry is an average of $t$ such images. Thus both transforms are contractions. The ring has zero divisors, so we verify character cancellation directly instead of dividing by $\omega_t^j-1$.
