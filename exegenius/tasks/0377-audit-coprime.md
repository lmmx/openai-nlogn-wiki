# exegenius task 0377-audit-coprime

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Coprime

Two integers are coprime when their greatest common divisor is $1$, that is, when no integer greater than $1$ divides both. It matters because the integer product's transform lengths must be pairwise coprime, so that several cyclic axes of those lengths combine into one axis of their product length; the [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md) rests on that fact.

For integers $\beta$ and $\gamma$, not both zero, $\gcd(\beta,\gamma)$ denotes their greatest common divisor, the largest positive integer dividing both. Such integers are coprime when $\gcd(\beta,\gamma)=1$.

For integers $\nu_1,\dots,\nu_N$, where $N$ is the number of integers in the family, the family is pairwise coprime when $\gcd(\nu_u,\nu_v)=1$ for all indices $u\neq v$ in $\{1,\dots,N\}$. This is stronger than having no common divisor above $1$: the family $4,6,35$ has none, but $\gcd(4,6)=2$.

Pairwise coprime integers have least common multiple equal to their product. Let $\operatorname{lcm}(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_t)$ denote the smallest positive integer divisible by each $\nu_u$ with $u\le t$, and write $L_t$ for it. A prime dividing both $L_t$ and $\nu_{t+1}$ would divide some $\nu_u$ with $u\le t$ and also $\nu_{t+1}$, which coprimality forbids. Since $\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=ab/\gcd(a,b)$, this gives $L_{t+1}=L_t\nu_{t+1}$, and induction on $t$ yields $\operatorname{lcm}(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_N)=\nu_1\cdots\nu_N$.
The transform argument uses the group $\mathbb{Z}/\nu_1\times\cdots\times\mathbb{Z}/\nu_N$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the integers and $\mathbb{Z}/\nu$ the integers modulo $\nu$, with addition taken mod $\nu$; tuples add entrywise. Let $g=(1,\dots,1)$. Its order is the least positive integer $e$ with $e\,g=0$; since $e\,g=0$ exactly when every $\nu_u$ divides $e$, the order of $g$ is $\operatorname{lcm}(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_N)$. When the $\nu_u$ are pairwise coprime this is $\nu_1\cdots\nu_N$, so $g$ generates a cyclic group (one generated by a single element) with as many elements as the product of the lengths.

The paper states the requirement for its integer product directly:. Its lengths meet it:.

Let $s_1,\dots,s_d$ be these lengths, $S=s_1\cdots s_d$ the length of the combined axis, and $P_i=s_1\cdots s_{i-1}$ with $P_1=1$. Each $P_i$ is coprime to $s_i$, so it has an inverse $\mu_i$ modulo $s_i$: an integer with $P_i\mu_i\equiv 1 \pmod{s_i}$. The map that splits the length-$S$ axis sends its generator to $(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_d)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/s_1\times\cdots\times\mathbb{Z}/s_d$, a group of $S$ elements. Each $\mu_i$ has order $s_i$ in $\mathbb{Z}/s_i$, so the tuple has order $\operatorname{lcm}(s_1,\dots,s_d)$, which equals $S$ because. The image therefore has order $S$.
