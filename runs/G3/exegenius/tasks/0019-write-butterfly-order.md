# exegenius task 0019-write-butterfly-order

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/G3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has finished an undergraduate computer science degree: algorithm analysis with asymptotic notation and recurrences, discrete mathematics (induction, divisibility, gcd, primes, permutations, summations, modular arithmetic at the level of residues), the schoolbook and divide-and-conquer integer arithmetic algorithms, sorting, and the fast Fourier transform as an O(n log n) convolution algorithm.

Concept: Radix-2 butterflies and stored frequency order
Gloss: The decimation-in-frequency recursion applies the two-point butterfly H₀(u,v) = ((u+v)/2, (u−v)/2) and a twiddle shift at each level, writing outputs in bit-reversed order that the opposite transform consumes directly.

## This page in the argument

The step: The decimation-in-frequency recursion applies $H_0$ and a twiddle shift at each level, writing the outputs in bit-reversed order $B_tF_t^-$ that the opposite transform $F_t^+B_t^{-1}$ consumes directly.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Reduce the product to a cyclic convolution of radix digits, evaluate it with Fourier-type transforms whose data movement and butterfly layers are accelerated by two power-saving tape procedures, recover the exact integers by rounding and carries, and add up the costs. (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- The normalized cyclic convolution of arrays of polynomials over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ on power-of-two axes is computed from the retained transform layout in time $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$.; how: Compute two forward synthetic transforms on a layout where every round is a simultaneous butterfly layer, multiply the transformed records pointwise by signed packing in the stored frequency order, and apply the opposite transform. (on [Convolution from the retained transform layout](synthetic-convolution.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md): Fourier-type transforms F_t^± over the negacyclic ring using the roots ω_t = y^{2r/t}, so multiplication by a root is a free signed shift; their character sums cancel to give F⁺F⁻ = I/t.
  Shown as: Radix-2 butterflies and stored frequency order *<predicate>* Synthetic polynomial transforms

## Pages that build on this one

- Fast simultaneous butterfly layer: The two-point butterfly H₀ applied at once to one bit position of each of up to d address chunks of polynomial records costs O(V d^λ′) with λ′ < 1, evaluated exactly in Gaussian dyadics and truncated once.
- Tape layout for synthetic transforms: A positional permutation of record addresses puts the selected bits of all participating axes at a common offset in consecutive K-bit chunks, so each transform round is one simultaneous butterfly layer.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "The two outputs of $H_0$ occupy these same slots" (paper)

  > Write \[ H_0=\frac12\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}. \] The length-one procedure is the identity. For $t\geq2$, the decimation-in-frequency step pairs $z_k$ with $z_{k+t/2}$ for $0\leq k<t/2$. The two outputs of $H_0$ occupy these same slots, whose high address bit is $b=0$ or $b=1$, respectively. Multiply the $b=1$ output by $\omega_t^{-k}$, and then apply the length-$t/2$ procedure separately within the two branches. This computes $F_t^-$ because, for $b\in\{0,1\}$, \begin{equation} (F_t^-z)_{2h+b} =\frac1{t/2}\sum_{k=0}^{t/2-1} (\omega_t^2)^{-hk}\omega_t^{-bk} \frac{z_k+(-1)^b z_{k+t/2}}2. \label{eq:synthetic-dif} \end{equation} To follow the recursion, name the original address-bit slots of an axis of length $t=2^a$ by $a-1,\ldots,0$, from most to least significant. For $0\leq s\leq a$, after $s$ levels the values of the first $s$ named slots are branch bits $b_0,\ldots,b_{s-1}$. Equation~\eqref{eq:synthetic-dif} identifies these

- "entry $(F_t^-z)_j$ occupies slot $\operatorname{rev}_a(j)$" (paper)

  > After all $a$ rounds, the named slots from high to low therefore contain the frequency bits from low to high. If $\operatorname{rev}_a(j)$ reverses the $a$ binary digits of $j$, the entry $(F_t^-z)_j$ occupies slot $\operatorname{rev}_a(j)$. Let $B_t$ denote this record permutation: it moves the entry at $j$ to $\operatorname{rev}_a(j)$. The recursion writes its outputs directly in this order; it does not move whole frequency indices.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0019-write-butterfly-order.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0019-write-butterfly-order.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0019-write-butterfly-order` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0019-write-butterfly-order`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
