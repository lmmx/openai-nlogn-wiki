Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F8V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Simultaneous butterfly layer
Gloss: Applying H₀ to the same bit position in each of D≤d address chunks at once, on polynomial records of complex fixed-point coefficients, in O(V d^{λ'}) time with one final truncation.

## This page in the argument

The step: Applying $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ to the same bit position in each of $D\le d$ address chunks of $K$ bits at once, on polynomial records with complex fixed-point coefficients, costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with one final truncation.
How: Run the complex phase network on groups of $e=mf$ chunks, implement its binary changes of basis by packed selected-bit additions, split rows among the $W$ roles, and unroll the resulting recurrence with exact dyadic arithmetic.
Why: Separate butterfly factors would need $D$ whole-array passes, so the $D$ butterflies must be applied simultaneously through the rank-saving network. (the sources say so: "factors would require $D$ whole-array passes." (paper))
Striking feature: A layer on $d$ chunks costs only $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'=1-2^{-54}<1$, rather than the $d$ full passes of separate butterflies. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- A $C$-tensor layer on $e=mf$ selected chunks is computed by $s_{\rm c}$ child layers on $f$ chunks each, after binary changes of basis, and converts to the normalized $H_0$ layer exactly.
- A binary row addition $y_{j_i}\leftarrow y_{j_i}\oplus x_{j_i}$ on the selected bits of $f$ chunks, with a third chunk restored, costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ in the family of parameters used here. (on [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md))
- Unrolling the recursion over $e$ selected chunks, with node cost $O((eK)^\tau+1)$ and $s/W<m^\sigma$, gives total normalized cost $O(d^{\lambda'})$ for a layer on at most $d$ chunks.
- All intermediate Gaussian dyadic values of a layer are exact with $p+\Delta$ fractional and $\Delta+3$ integer bits, where $\Delta=\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil=o(p)$, so only one truncation follows the layer.
- The simultaneous normalized butterfly layer returns $Q_p(\mathcal Hz)$ in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$, staying in the unit disk.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Build two faster tape procedures (address chunk interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) from rank-saving linear networks, use them in synthetic polynomial transforms and resampled source transforms for a convolution, reduce integer multiplication to that convolution, then prove exactness and add up costs. (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (C.1, C.3, C.4, C.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**C.1**: A $C$-tensor layer on $e=mf$ selected chunks is computed by $s_{\rm c}$ child layers on $f$ chunks each, after binary changes of basis, and converts to the normalized $H_0$ layer exactly.
How: Express each edge frame change as a product of two-point kernels, move the residual directions to coordinate positions by binary row additions, call children on the $m$ slots, and use $H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_DC^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D$.
- C.1.1: Direct multiplication gives the identities $H_0=b\mathsf SC\mathsf S$, $C^2=X$, $C^4=I$.
  Source: "H_0=b\mathsf SC\mathsf S,\qquad C^2=X,\qquad C^4=I,\qquad" (paper)
  > Put \[ H_0=\frac12\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix},\qquad H=\sqrt2 H_0,\qquad \mathsf S=\operatorname{diag}(1,i),\qquad Z=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1). \] For the bit-flip matrix $X=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$, define \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-C} C=H\mathsf SH=aI+bX,\qquad a=\frac{1+i}{2},\quad b=\frac{1-i}{2}. \end{equation} Direct multiplication gives \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-basic-identities} H_0=b\mathsf SC\mathsf S,\qquad C^2=X,\qquad C^4=I,\qquad C^{-1}=bI+aX=-iZCZ. \end{equation} In particular, $C=iZC^{-1}Z$. These identities use only Gaussian dyadic coefficients. The Hadamard matrices in the definition of $\mathcal C_U$ are used to prove identities; they need not be executed by the machine.
- C.1.2: An edge's frame change is a product of $\rho_{\rm edge}$ directional kernels $(aI+bX_{v_j})^{\epsilon_j}$, one per orthonormal basis vector of its residual.
  Source: "=\prod_{j=1}^{\rho_{\rm edge}}(aI+bX_{v_j})^{\epsilon_j}," (paper)
  > Consider an edge from label $U_-$ to label $U_+$, and choose an orthonormal basis $v_1,\ldots,v_{\rho_{\rm edge}}$ of its residual. Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface} gives the frame change \[ \mathcal C_{U_+}\mathcal C_{U_-}^{-1} =\prod_{j=1}^{\rho_{\rm edge}}(aI+bX_{v_j})^{\epsilon_j}, \qquad \epsilon_j\in\{1,-1\}. \] Here $(X_vf)(x)=f(x+v)$, and we write $C_v=aI+bX_v$. The number of directional kernels is precisely $\rho_{\rm edge}$, including on decreasing edges. The next step puts those directions into coordinate positions without performing a general transpose.
- C.1.3: A negative directional kernel still needs only one forward child, since $(C^{-1})^{\otimes f}=(-i)^fZ^{\otimes f}C^{\otimes f}Z^{\otimes f}$.
  Source: "=(-i)^f Z^{\otimes f}C^{\otimes f}Z^{\otimes f}." (paper)
  > To implement \eqref{eq:phase-edge-coordinate} on the group, first apply $\mathcal P_M^{-1}$ separately to each column. For each $1\le h\le\rho_{\rm edge}$, apply $(C^{\epsilon_h})^{\otimes f}$ to the $f$ bits $x_{h,0},\ldots,x_{h,f-1}$. This is one child operation on the $f$ axes in slot $h$. Finally apply $\mathcal P_M$ to every column. A negative directional kernel still requires only one forward child, because \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-inverse-child} (C^{-1})^{\otimes f} =(-i)^f Z^{\otimes f}C^{\otimes f}Z^{\otimes f}. \end{equation} The rightmost phase is applied first. All inverse wrappers are address signs and constant fourth-root phases, so they add no recursive calls.
- C.1.4: Any invertible binary change of basis is a product of at most $m(m-1)+3m$ elementary row additions, each changing corresponding selected bits in two whole slots.
  Source: "as a product of at most $m(m-1)+3m$ elementary row additions: one clears" (paper)
  > Gaussian elimination expresses any $M\in\operatorname{GL}(m,\mathbb F_2)$ as a product of at most $m(m-1)+3m$ elementary row additions: one clears at most $m-1$ other entries per pivot, and each row swap is three row additions. Reversing the elimination gives the required product since each row addition is an involution. The number is a constant because $m$ is fixed. Adding row $h'$ to row $h$ in every column applies $x_{h,j}\leftarrow x_{h,j}\mathbin\oplus x_{h',j}$ for every $0\le j<f$. Thus one row addition changes corresponding selected positions in two whole slots. The packed address operation proved below performs all of these XORs together.
- C.1.5: Summing residual dimensions gives exactly $s_{\rm c}$ child calls, each on the $f=e/m$ axes of one slot.
  Source: "$s_{\rm c}$ child calls, each on the $f=e/m$ axes of one slot." (paper)
  > \paragraph{The exact recursive contract.} Apply the finite network with these column frames to a group of $e=mf$ selected axes. Summing its residual dimensions gives exactly $s_{\rm c}$ child calls, each on the $f=e/m$ axes of one slot. The source and sink $Z_{a,f}$ signs, together with the scalar $i^{27f}$ at each affected sink, turn every endpoint kernel into a forward one. Negating the prescribed physical bank and undoing its exchange returns each result to its original role. Proposition~\ref{prop:complex-motif-interface} therefore gives $C^{\otimes e}$ on every role, including roles whose initial scratch values were arbitrary. Formula~\eqref{eq:phase-inverse-child} supplies each inverse child from one forward call, and none of the corrections adds a child. The remaining operations are a fixed number of binary row additions and coefficientwise scalar operations.
- C.1.6: Applying the basic identities on all selected coordinates gives $H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_DC^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D$.
  Source: "H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_D C^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D." (paper)
  > \paragraph{Returning to normalized butterflies.} For an address $x$ in a full layer, write $x_1,\ldots,x_D$ for its selected bits. The diagonal operator $\mathcal S_D$ multiplies the value stored at an address by the phase determined by those bits: \[ (\mathcal S_D z)(x)=i^{x_1+\cdots+x_D}z(x). \] Here the unselected address bits are unchanged, and the same phase is applied to every coefficient stored at that address. Applying \eqref{eq:phase-basic-identities} on all selected coordinates gives \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-butterfly-layer} H_0^{\otimes D}=b^D\mathcal S_D C^{\otimes D}\mathcal S_D. \end{equation} The scalar is \[ b^D=(-i/2)^{\lfloor D/2\rfloor}b^{D\bmod2}, \] so it is a binary shift and fourth-root phase, with at most one further factor $b$. All phases, inverse wrappers, and scalar corrections above are exact Gaussian dyadic operations. Thus, once the physical binary basis changes and recursive stream layout are supplied, the complete parallel butterfly layer is exact up to its prescribed final truncation.

**C.3**: Unrolling the recursion over $e$ selected chunks, with node cost $O((eK)^\tau+1)$ and $s/W<m^\sigma$, gives total normalized cost $O(d^{\lambda'})$ for a layer on at most $d$ chunks.
How: Split rows among the $W$ roles so each child has volume $V/W$, write the normalized cost recurrence $F(e)\le(s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)$, stop the recursion below $d^\beta$ chunks, and sum the geometric series.
- C.3.1: Binary changes of basis, scalar gates, endpoint corrections and reassembly cost $O(V((eK)^\tau+1))$ at a node, using the packed row addition.
  Source: "endpoint corrections and reassembly of the physical banks cost" (paper)
  > First consider an internal node containing \(e=m^k\) consecutive active chunks, with \(k\ge1\). Split it into \(m\) consecutive slots, each containing \(e/m\) chunks. The phase construction supplies one recursive call on a slot for each vector in an edge residual basis, hence exactly \(s\) calls in one invocation of the network. If the logical volume entering this node is \(V\), binary changes of basis, their inverses, scalar gates, endpoint corrections and reassembly of the physical banks cost \[ O\bigl(V((eK)^\tau+1)\bigr) \] at this node. Each slot has \((e/m)K\) address bits, so Lemma~\ref{lem:packed-selected-bit-rectangle} gives the stated bound for a row addition. The network and all of its \(m\)-dimensional residual bases are fixed, so the total number of row additions is fixed as well. At the same guarded width, the scalar gates cost a constant number of scans of the current volume. Address and descriptor work bounded by any fixed polynomial in \(p\) per record is also absorbed: its ratio to the record's \(\Theta(rp)\) bits tends to zero.
- C.3.2: Row indices are split among the $W$ roles, so each recursive edge call acts on a stream of volume exactly $1/W$ of its parent's.
  Source: "one role stream with volume exactly \(1/W\) of its parent" (paper)
  > At a node, write a row index as \(u=Wg+w\), with \(0\le w<W\), and send that entire row to physical wire role \(w\), indexed there by \(g\). Every role stream has the same remaining address shape. Thus a pointwise gate reads the records with the same \(g\) and the same remaining address in its touched roles. The scalar network allows these role values to be arbitrary, so the split supplies its scratch roles from existing rows. Each recursive edge call acts on one role stream with volume exactly \(1/W\) of its parent's logical volume.
- C.3.3: Time divided by volume obeys $F(e)\le(s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)$, with $F(e)=O(e)$ below the cut-off $e<d^\beta$.
  Source: "F(e)\le (s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1)," (paper)
  > \paragraph{Unrolling the recurrence.} Fix \(\beta=1/2\), and choose real exponents satisfying \[ 0<\tau<1,\qquad \max\{0,\log_m(s/W)\}\le\sigma<1, \qquad \max\{\tau,\sigma\}<\lambda<1, \qquad \tau(1+c/\beta)<\lambda. \] The exponents can all be chosen rational, with a strict upper bound in the condition on \(\sigma\). Stop recursion when \(e<d^\beta\) and apply the \(e\) \(C\) kernels individually. If \(F(e)\) denotes time divided by the current logical stream volume, then \[ F(e)\le (s/W)F(e/m)+O((eK)^\tau+1), \qquad F(e)=O(e)\quad(e<d^\beta). \] Indeed, the \(s\) child calls are executed on streams of volume \(V/W\), so their total cost is \(s(V/W)F(e/m)\). Dividing by the current volume \(V\) gives the factor \(s/W\). At an internal node \(e\ge d^\beta\), hence \(K\le d^c\le e^{c/\beta}\). The overhead is therefore \(O(e^{\tau(1+c/\beta)}+1)=O(e^\lambda)\). Put \(a=s/W\). Since \(a\le m^\sigma<m^\lambda\), the internal costs sum to at most \[ C e^\lambda\sum_{j\ge0}(a/m^\lambda)^j=O(e^\lambda). \] If the leaves after \(j\) levels contain \(u=e/m^j<d^\beta\) active chunks each, their combined normalized contribution is at most \[ O(a^ju)\le O(e^\sigma u^{1-\sigma}) \le O(e^\sigma d^{\beta(1-\sigma)}). \] The first inequality uses \(a^j\le m^{j\sigma}=(e/u)^\sigma\). It also covers \(a<1\) by taking \(\sigma\ge0\).
- C.3.4: Summing internal and leaf contributions and the base-$m$ pieces gives $O(d^{\lambda'})$ for any fixed $\lambda'$ with $\max\{\lambda,\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)\}<\lambda'<1$.
  Source: "=O(d^{\lambda'})" (paper)
  > Write \(D-q_0=\sum_j a_jm^j\) in base \(m\), with \(0\le a_j<m\). Partition the remaining chunks into \(a_j\) consecutive pieces containing \(m^j\) chunks for each \(j\). There are at most \((m-1)(1+\lfloor\log_m d\rfloor)\) pieces. Adding their costs and the row preprocessing gives \[ O\!\left(\log(2d) \bigl[d^\lambda+d^{\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)}+1\bigr]\right) =O(d^{\lambda'}) \] for any fixed \[ \max\{\lambda,\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)\}<\lambda'<1. \] The case \(D\le q_0\), in which preprocessing would consume all active chunks, was handled by individual kernels. Thus all constants and all tape counts are independent of \(p,d,r\) and the input data.

**C.4**: All intermediate Gaussian dyadic values of a layer are exact with $p+\Delta$ fractional and $\Delta+3$ integer bits, where $\Delta=\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil=o(p)$, so only one truncation follows the layer.
How: Bound the arithmetic dependency depth $A(e)\le sA(e/m)+E$ along the recursion, and note each operation at most doubles the modulus or adds one denominator bit.
- C.4.1: The depth of a chain of arithmetic operations obeys $A(e)\le sA(e/m)+E$ at an internal node, hence it is polynomial $O(d^{C_1})$ in $d$.
  Source: "A(e)\le sA(e/m)+E" (paper)
  > The paired evaluation in \eqref{eq:individual-C-pair} uses at most eight elementary operations: form the sum and difference, multiply the difference by \(i\), then form the two half-sums. We may therefore use \[ A(e)\le sA(e/m)+E \quad\hbox{at an internal node},\qquad A(e)\le8e \quad\hbox{at a leaf}. \] The depth estimate concatenates the \(s\) calls, so it uses \(s\). The factor \(1/W\) in the earlier time recurrence accounted for their smaller stream volumes.
- C.4.2: Reserving $p+\Delta$ fractional bits and $\Delta+3$ integer and sign bits per real component represents every intermediate coefficient exactly and prevents overflow.
  Source: "Thus reserving \(p+\Delta\)" (paper)
  > To see how this count controls numerical size, start with disk-valued coefficients in \(2^{-p}\mathbb Z[i]\). A value at depth \(\ell\) lies in \(2^{-(p+\ell)}\mathbb Z[i]\) and has modulus at most \(2^\ell\). This follows by induction: addition or subtraction can at most double the maximum modulus of its operands; halving adds at most one denominator bit; and signs and multiplication by \(i\) preserve both bounds. The charge of \(t\) for the final shift is the same as \(t\) successive halvings. Thus reserving \(p+\Delta\) fractional bits and \(\Delta+3\) integer and sign bits per real component represents every intermediate coefficient exactly and prevents overflow. Shifts consume the reserved fractional zeros and discard no bits.

**C.5**: The simultaneous normalized butterfly layer returns $Q_p(\mathcal Hz)$ in $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ time with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$, staying in the unit disk.
How: Combine the cost of the recursion with the exact evaluation and the single truncation, using that $\mathcal H$ has row sums of modulus one.
- C.5.1: The row construction and recurrence analysis give total time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ on fixed tapes, including padding, repair and cleanup.
  Source: "above give total time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ on fixed tapes, including" (paper)
  > Uniformly for large $p$, the bands give $f\le d\le p$ and \[ K\ge\tfrac12a_d^c p^{\epsilon c},\qquad r\ge2^{(a_r/b_d)p^{1-\epsilon}}. \] The first inequality follows from $K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor$ once $d^c\ge2$. In particular, $K\ge6$ and $K/\log p\to\infty$, while $r$ dominates every fixed polynomial. Substituting the common bound $A_*\le C_Ap$ into the two additional normalized terms in \eqref{eq:packed-rectangle-time} gives \[ \begin{aligned} \frac{A_*^3}{R_{\rm g}} &\le\frac{C_A^3p^2}{2r},\\ 80(f-1)2^{-K}A_*\left(1+\frac{A_*}{R_{\rm g}}\right) &\le80C_Ap^2 2^{-K}\left(1+\frac{C_A}{2r}\right). \end{aligned} \] Both bounds tend to zero uniformly over all current allowed $d,r$. Thus Lemma~\ref{lem:packed-selected-bit-rectangle} has the required $O(M_{\rm child}R_{\rm g}(L^\tau+1))$ cost for every packed call, with one common time constant. The row construction and the recurrence analysis above give total time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ on fixed tapes, including all padded and auxiliary streams. Equation~\eqref{eq:phase-butterfly-layer} converts the resulting exact $C$-layer to $\mathcal H$.
- C.5.2: $\mathcal H$ maps disk arrays to disk arrays and componentwise truncation preserves the disk with error below $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$.
  Source: "Thus $\mathcal H$ maps disk arrays to disk" (paper)
  > The guard-width calculation above bounds both denominator and magnitude growth by $\lceil C_0d^{C_1}\rceil$. Since $d\le b_dp^\epsilon$ and $\epsilon C_1<1$, this is $o(p)$ uniformly over the allowed $d$, so every intermediate coefficient is represented exactly with the stated $O(p)$ width. The initial scan removes or adds only redundant leading sign bits and appends the reserved fractional zeros to put each supplied component in this guarded format. To truncate toward zero at the end, shift its absolute numerator right by the number of added fractional bits, restore its sign, and write the result in $w$ bits. These scans cost $O(V)$. Finally, every row of $\mathcal H$ has absolute row sum one. Thus $\mathcal H$ maps disk arrays to disk arrays, and componentwise truncation preserves that disk and has error less than $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$: truncation cannot increase the absolute value of either component, and changes each by less than $2^{-p}$. The truncated numerators have magnitude at most $2^p$, so the supplied component width can hold them. \end{proof} \section{Synthetic transforms and their tape layout} \label{sec:synthetic-layouts}

- C.2 (on [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md)): A binary row addition $y_{j_i}\leftarrow y_{j_i}\oplus x_{j_i}$ on the selected bits of $f$ chunks, with a third chunk restored, costs $O(V(L^\tau+1))$ in the family of parameters used here.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Complex phase network](phase-frame-network.md): The second network over Gaussian dyadics with binary labels, whose frames are built from the two-point kernel C=HSH=aI+bX, so each edge is a product of translation kernels and the endpoint operator is C^{⊗m} on every role.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Complex phase network
- [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-selected-bit-addition.md): XORing corresponding selected bits of many chunks at once by a constant number of whole-chunk cyclic shifts that are correct away from a small set of guard-violating addresses, which are then repaired deterministically by sorting.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Packed selected-bit addition
- [Recursive rank saving](rank-saving-recurrence.md): Splitting rows among the W network roles makes each recursive call a 1/W-volume stream, so the cost per volume grows by s/W<m when the parameter is multiplied by m, giving a power saving.

- [Fast Fourier transform with butterflies](fft-butterflies.md): Computing a length-2^a transform in a levels, each pairing entries by a two-point butterfly H₀(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u−v)/2) followed by a twiddle multiplication.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer *<predicate>* Fast Fourier transform with butterflies
- [Fixed-point complex grid and truncation](fixed-point-complex-arithmetic.md): Complex numbers stored as signed two's-complement numerators over 2^p, in the unit disk, with truncation toward zero to the grid after exact dyadic arithmetic.

## Pages that build on this one

- Transform layout on tape: Placing the selected bit of each participating axis at a common offset in consecutive K-bit chunks, using bit moves and chunk interchanges, so that each transform round is one simultaneous butterfly layer.
- Parameter regime for the multiplier: The choice of precision p=6b, dimension d≈p^ε, record length r=2^Θ(p^(1−ε)), power-of-two axis lengths t_i and distinct prime source lengths s_i just below them, so that Tp=Θ(n) and all hypotheses hold.
- Cost accounting and the exponent κ: Dividing every cost by V=Tp gives normalized costs that are at most p^(1−2κ), the smallest margin 2^−181 coming from the chunk-exchange term, giving total time O(n(log n)^(1−κ)).

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$" (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.

- "whereas separate butterfly factors would require $D$ whole-array passes." (paper)

  > The parameters will satisfy \[ d=\Theta(p^\epsilon),\qquad K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor, \qquad r=2^{\Theta(p/d)},\qquad c>0,\quad 0<\epsilon<1. \] The exponents and comparison constants are fixed, and we impose their further restrictions in Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer}. Two consequences explain the layout. The polynomial length $r$ grows faster than every fixed power of $p$, so a scan of a record pays for polynomial work on its address. Also $K/\log p\to\infty$, which will make the exceptional set in a packed change of address bits small enough to repair by sorting. We will obtain cost $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$, with $\lambda'<1$ and $V$ the logical bit volume, whereas separate butterfly factors would require $D$ whole-array passes.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

```

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0026-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0026-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0026-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0026-write-simultaneous-butterfly-layer`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
