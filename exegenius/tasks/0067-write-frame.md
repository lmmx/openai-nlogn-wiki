# exegenius task 0067-write-frame

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Frame of a vertex
Gloss: An invertible linear operator attached to a gate or terminal that sets how the array on each wire there is stored; changing frames along an edge cancels between the two ends of a route.

- Nested subspace labels: Assignments of subspaces of a fixed space to the gates and terminals of a network, nested along edges, whose dimension drops measure the smaller operations needed on each edge.
- Rank-saving recursion: A recursive scheme in which an edge matrix of rank a costs a smaller calls and the total number s of smaller calls over W roles satisfies s < Wm, so that multiplying the parameter by m multiplies the cost by less than m per unit volume.
- Simultaneous butterfly layer H₀: The map H₀(u,v) = ((u+v)/2, (u−v)/2) applied at once to a selected coordinate bit of every chunk, a two-point butterfly acting coefficientwise on polynomial records.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "We call $D_v$ its frame" (paper)

  > The representation of a role's array may change along the network. At a source, gate, or sink $v$, choose an invertible linear operator $D_v$ on the space of arrays indexed by the common address set. We call $D_v$ its frame: the stored array is $D_vg$ when the logical array is $g$. All incidences of one gate have the same frame. Along an edge from $u$ to $v$, the operator $D_vD_u^{-1}$ changes the stored array from $D_ug$ to $D_vg$. At a pointwise linear gate $G$, the common frame commutes with the gate: \[ G(D_vg_1,\ldots,D_vg_t)=D_vG(g_1,\ldots,g_t). \] The supplied input needs no preliminary change of frame: its logical interpretation is defined by applying the inverse input frame. Thus the intermediate frames cancel, and a route from input role $w$ to output role $\rho(w)$ applies $D_{\mathrm{sink}(\rho(w))}D_{\mathrm{source}(w)}^{-1}$, together with its prescribed scalar sign. Undoing the role exchange and those signs leaves the endpoint operator on every role array, including the roles that carried auxiliary scalar values.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "A pointwise linear gate commutes with its common frame" (The page states the commutation as the reason the gate computes on stored arrays, but without the definition of a pointwise linear gate the reader cannot check it, and the page gives no argument for it.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- Say what $D_u$ denotes where it is first used (for a size or count, what it counts): "Along the edge, the frame change $D_vD_u^{-1}$ converts the stored form at $u$ into the stored form at $v$." (The page defines the frame only for D_v, with v a generic vertex. The reader can infer by symmetry that D_u is the frame of the vertex u, but the page never states that D_u denotes the frame at u.)
- Explain "common address set" in a sentence where it is first used.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 227 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 283 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

A frame of a vertex is an invertible linear operator attached to a gate or terminal in a [Linear network](linear-network.md) that fixes how the array on each wire there is stored. Frames let the network keep data in different stored forms at different vertices, while the net effect of a route on each role's array stays a single endpoint operator, which the interchange argument needs.

Let $u$ and $v$ be vertices joined by an edge from $u$ to $v$, where a vertex is a source, gate or sink of the network. The frame $D_v$ is an invertible linear operator on the space of arrays indexed by the common address set, and all incidences of one gate share its frame. If $g$ is the logical array, the stored array is $D_v g$.

Along the edge, the frame change $D_vD_u^{-1}$ converts the stored form at $u$ into the stored form at $v$. <cite data-source="paper">changes the stored array from $D_ug$ to $D_vg$</cite> For example, if $D_u$ is the identity and $D_v = 2I$, then a logical array $g$ is stored as $g$ at $u$ and as $2g$ at $v$, and the change along the edge doubles it.

A pointwise linear gate commutes with its common frame, so it computes on stored arrays as it would on logical ones.

The argument needs frames because a role's array may change representation along the network. Composing the frame changes along a route leaves only the frames at its two ends, which is the cancellation the argument uses. <cite data-source="paper">the intermediate frames cancel</cite>

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:
