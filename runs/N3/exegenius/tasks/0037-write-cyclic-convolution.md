Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e5/N3` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Cyclic convolution
Gloss: The product in C[x]/(x^S − 1), or its multidimensional analogue on a product of cyclic axes, which Fourier transforms turn into pointwise multiplication.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- Normalized convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/(rM)$ over $\mathcal R_r$ is approximated with error below $\sqrt2M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ at the transform cost plus $O(Tp\log(rp))$. (on [Normalized convolution over the polynomial ring](synthetic-convolution.md))
- Since $LB$ permutes records, $P(LBu,LBv)=LBP(u,v)$, so the opposite transform applied to the stored product gives $\mathcal M_r(f,g)$.
- With chirp $a$, $QF_{\boldsymbol t}u=\overline a\cdot(a*(\overline a\cdot u))/T$, so the middle transform with its target permutation is a normalized cyclic convolution. (on [Bluestein's chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md))
- $(RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+)[(RF_{\boldsymbol s}u)\cdot(RF_{\boldsymbol s}v)]=(u*v)/S^2$, so the retained source permutation cancels. (on [Source permutation cancellation](source-permutation-cancellation.md))
- With $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ digits in base $2^b$, the product's digits are a convolution modulo $x^S-1$ with no wraparound and coefficients below $2^{3b}$. (on [Radix-digit reduction to convolution](radix-digit-convolution.md))
- $x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$ is an isomorphism onto the product of prime cyclic axes, preserving convolution, and is implemented by triangular controlled shifts. (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-address-map.md))
- The twist $x_d\mapsto\zeta y$ turns complex cyclic convolution on the last axis into negacyclic convolution over $\mathcal R_r$, with the wrap recovered after untwisting. (on [Coefficient twist](coefficient-twist.md))

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Normalized discrete Fourier transform](discrete-fourier-transform.md): The map (F_q u)_k = (1/q) Σ_j u_j e^{−2πijk/q} (and its opposite-sign version F_q^+), a contraction in the max-modulus norm; tensor products F_q over several axes give multidimensional transforms.
  Shown as: Cyclic convolution *<predicate>* Normalized discrete Fourier transform

## Pages that build on this one

- Radix-digit reduction to convolution: Splitting each n-bit input into q = ⌈n/b⌉ digits in base 2^b so that the product's digits are the convolution of the two digit lists, bounded below 2^{3b}, followed by carry propagation.
- Chinese-remainder address map: The algebra isomorphism x ↦ Π x_i^{μ_i} from C[x]/(x^S−1) to the product of cyclic axes of pairwise coprime prime lengths s_i, which preserves convolution and is implemented as triangular controlled shifts.
- Bluestein's chirp identity: The identity Q F_t u = ā · (a * (ā · u))/T with chirp a_j = exp(−πi Σ s_i j_i²/t_i), converting the middle transform together with its target permutation into a normalized cyclic convolution and two pointwise phase multiplications.
- Coefficient twist: The isomorphism x_d ↦ ζy with ζ = e^{πi/r} from C[x_d]/(x_d^r − 1) to C[y]/(y^r + 1), which turns the last cyclic coordinate into a negacyclic polynomial whose wrap recovers the cyclic wrap after untwisting.
- Normalized convolution over the polynomial ring: Computing 𝓜_r(f, g) = (f*g)/(rM) for arrays over 𝓡_r by two forward synthetic transforms kept in the same stored frequency order, packed pointwise ring products, and the opposite transform consuming that order.
- Source permutation cancellation: The identity (R F_s^+)[(R F_s u)·(R F_s v)] = (u*v)/S², showing that the source permutation R retained in the forward transforms cancels against the opposite-sign transform, so convolution needs no sort.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Thus convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no nonzero wraparound." (paper)

  > Write the two inputs as polynomials in $2^b$, each with $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ nonnegative digits. Their product has degree at most \[ 2q-2<2n/b\le T/2<S. \] Thus convolution modulo $x^S-1$ has no nonzero wraparound. Every product coefficient obeys \begin{equation}\label{eq:capacity} 0\le c_j\le q(2^b-1)^2<2^{3b}, \end{equation} since $q\le n\le2^b$.

- "For arrays on $\prod_i\mathbb Z/t_i\mathbb Z$ with values in $\mathcal R_r$, let $*$ denote cyclic convolution in the displayed axes" (paper)

  > For arrays on $\prod_i\mathbb Z/t_i\mathbb Z$ with values in $\mathcal R_r$, let $*$ denote cyclic convolution in the displayed axes and define \[ \mathcal M_r(f,g)=\frac{f*g}{rM}=\frac{f*g}{T}. \] For a fixed output coefficient, each of the $M$ first cyclic addresses determines one second address, and each of the $r$ first polynomial indices determines one second index modulo $r$. The negacyclic wrap supplies the sign. Thus that coefficient averages $rM$ signed scalar products, and $\mathcal M_r$ is a bilinear contraction: \[ \|\mathcal M_r(f,g)\|_\infty \leq\|f\|_\infty\|g\|_\infty. \] If the other operand is a disk array, replacing one operand changes the output by at most the norm distance between its two values.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0037-write-cyclic-convolution.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0037-write-cyclic-convolution.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0037-write-cyclic-convolution` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0037-write-cyclic-convolution`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
