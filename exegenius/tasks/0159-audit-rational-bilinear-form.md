# exegenius task 0159-audit-rational-bilinear-form

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

A term, symbol or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term, symbol or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- symbol: notation used without being defined on the page.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Rational bilinear form

A bilinear form is a function $B(x, y)$ of two vectors that is linear in each argument separately. Linearity in $x$ means $B(\alpha x + \beta x', y) = \alpha B(x, y) + \beta B(x', y)$, and similarly in $y$. A bilinear form is *rational* when its coefficients are rational numbers.

For example, on pairs of numbers, $B((x_1, x_2), (y_1, y_2)) = 2x_1y_1 + x_1y_2 - \tfrac{1}{2}x_2y_2$ is a rational bilinear form. Fixing $y$ makes it a linear function of $x$, and fixing $x$ makes it a linear function of $y$.

Such forms are a natural way to express a count that depends on two sets of data at once. Evaluating a bilinear form on the indicator vectors of two subsets gives a value that depends on how the subsets relate, which is the kind of quantity the paper needs.

The paper uses a rational bilinear form to express the second of the two intersection formulas in its variant of the [Frankl–Wilson construction](frankl-wilson-construction.md). Because the form has rational coefficients, its values can be computed exactly on a tape.
