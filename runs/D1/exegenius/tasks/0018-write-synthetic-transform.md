# exegenius task 0018-write-synthetic-transform

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/D1` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Synthetic polynomial transforms
Gloss: Fourier transforms over the ring modulo y^r+1 using powers of y as roots, computed by signed shifts and butterflies and retaining one stored frequency order for the inverse.

## This page in the argument

The step: Convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ can be computed by synthetic transforms that use the simultaneous butterfly layers.
How: Do Fourier transforms over the ring with powers of $y$ as roots of unity, so roots act as signed shifts and the remaining work is butterflies, applied on a suitable layout
Why: Powers of y are roots of unity acting by exact signed permutations of coefficient lists, so only butterfly layers cost arithmetic. (the sources say so: "where the required roots of unity act by exact signed permutations" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Synthetic Fourier transforms over the ring modulo $y^r+1$ are laid out on tape so that the parallel layers apply, with a stored frequency order retained for the inverse.
- Products of polynomials over the ring are obtained exactly from one integer product by signed packing, using the known $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as a subroutine. (on [Signed packing (Kronecker substitution)](signed-packing.md))
- Convolution over the ring is computed from two forward synthetic transforms, a pointwise product and the opposite transform, with bounded error.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: Build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers) with power savings, use them in synthetic transforms, and place those in the reduction of multiplication to convolution (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ))](main-result.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S4.1, S4.3). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S4.1**: Synthetic Fourier transforms over the ring modulo $y^r+1$ are laid out on tape so that the parallel layers apply, with a stored frequency order retained for the inverse.
Source: "\begin{lemma}[Transform layout and cost]" (paper)
> \begin{lemma}[Transform layout and cost] \label{lem:synthetic-transform-cost} Fix the rational parameters and positive comparison constants $a_d\leq b_d$, $a_r\leq b_r$ of Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer}. Fix constants $C_\ell>0$ and $C_w>1$, and choose the layer constants once as \[ C_M=C_\ell+1,\qquad C_{\rm desc}=32(C_\ell+C_w+1). \] Use these constants and $C_w$ in Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer}. These fixed choices determine a cutoff $p_1$, one fixed-tape procedure, and an implicit time constant with the following guarantee. For every choice of positive integers $p,d,r$ with $p\geq p_1$ and \[ a_dp^\epsilon\leq d\leq b_dp^\epsilon,\qquad 2^{a_rp/d}\leq r\leq2^{b_rp/d}, \] suppose $d\geq2$ and $r=2^\ell$ with an integer $2\leq\ell<p$, and require \[ d\ell\leq C_\ell p,\qquad 1\leq K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor\leq\ell-1. \] Let $t_i\in\{2^{\ell-1},2^\ell\}$ for $1\leq i\leq d-1$, put $M=\prod_{i=1}^{d-1}t_i$ and $T=rM$, and let $w$ be an integer with $p+2\leq w\leq C_wp$. The cutoff and time constant are independent of $p,d,r$, these axis choices, the round headers constructed from them, and $w$ within the displayed bounds.

**S4.3**: Convolution over the ring is computed from two forward synthetic transforms, a pointwise product and the opposite transform, with bounded error.
Source: "\begin{proposition}[Convolution from the retained transform layout]" (paper)
> \begin{proposition}[Convolution from the retained transform layout] \label{prop:synthetic-convolution} Under the hypotheses of Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost}, $\mathcal M_r$ on disk grid operands has an approximation with error less than \begin{equation} \sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p} \label{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} \end{equation} and cost \[ O\left(Tp\left[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'} +\log(rp)\right]\right). \] Put $m_M=\log_2M$ and $w_M=w+m_M$. The returned grid array is in the original array and coefficient order, with the same two's-complement component format at width $w_M$. The procedure supplies $\Gamma(w_M)$ on the output descriptor tape, so the caller knows every component boundary from this width and the retained shape parameters. If one operand has norm at most $\rho<1$ and the bound in \eqref{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} is at most $1-\rho$, the returned grid array is a disk array. \end{proposition} \begin{proof} Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order. Pass the supplied $p,r,w$ to Lemma~\ref{lem:signed-ring-product} for corresponding polynomial records. Its output keeps that record order and uses the component format required by the opposite procedure. Apply the opposite procedure to that order, and multiply its result exactly by $M=T/r$.

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S4.2 (on [Signed packing (Kronecker substitution)](signed-packing.md)): Products of polynomials over the ring are obtained exactly from one integer product by signed packing, using the known $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as a subroutine.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Polynomial ring modulo y^r+1](negacyclic-ring.md): Complex polynomials of degree below r with y^r = -1, so powers of y act as roots of unity and multiplication by y^a is a signed shift of coefficients.

- [Two-point butterfly and fast transform levels](butterfly.md): The radix-2 step mapping (u,v) to ((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2); a fast transform applies lg n levels of these, each costing a scan of the data.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transforms *<predicate>* Two-point butterfly and fast transform levels
- [Address fields, streams and scans on tape](tape-layout-streams.md): Arrays stored in lexicographic address order on tape, with fields of address digits, processed by linear scans, controlled shifts and cyclic splitting into role streams.
  Shown as: Synthetic polynomial transforms *<predicate>* Address fields, streams and scans on tape

## Pages that build on this one

- Retaining permutations in the transform: The source permutation from resampling cancels across the two forward transforms, the pointwise product and the inverse transform, avoiding separate full sorts.
- Simultaneous butterfly layer on selected bits: Applying H_0 on the same bit position of up to d address chunks at once on polynomial records, with a complex phase network, in time O(V d^λ') with λ'<1, exact until one final truncation.
- Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)): A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)) time with κ=2^-182, disproving the n log n optimality conjecture in this model.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "These are the
synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and
Nussbaumer" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.

- "The two forward synthetic transforms
retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product" (paper)

  > Next, Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform, including its target permutation, into normalized cyclic convolution. A phase twist changes the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$; its negative wrap gives precisely the original cyclic wrap after the twist is removed. Sections~\ref{sec:synthetic-layouts} and~\ref{sec:exact-ring-products} compute convolution on the remaining axes over this polynomial ring. The two forward synthetic transforms retain the same frequency order through their pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes that order. Their polynomial products use signed packing and the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier as an ordinary subroutine.

- "If $j$ is an integer, then" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Synthetic character cancellation] \label{lem:synthetic-characters} If $j$ is an integer, then \[ \sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\omega_t^{jk} =\begin{cases}t,&t\mid j,\\0,&t\nmid j.\end{cases} \qquad F_t^+F_t^-=t^{-1}I. \] \end{lemma} \begin{proof} Only the second case needs proof. Write $j=2^v j_0$ with $j_0$ odd and $0\leq v<\log_2t$. Replacing $k$ by $k+t/2^{v+1}$ modulo $t$ permutes the summands and multiplies their sum by $y^{rj_0}=-1$. Hence the sum is zero, since the additive group of $\mathcal R_r$ has no two-torsion. Expanding the composite transforms and applying this identity proves the final formula. \end{proof}

- "\begin{lemma}[Transform layout and cost]" (paper)

  > \begin{lemma}[Transform layout and cost] \label{lem:synthetic-transform-cost} Fix the rational parameters and positive comparison constants $a_d\leq b_d$, $a_r\leq b_r$ of Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer}. Fix constants $C_\ell>0$ and $C_w>1$, and choose the layer constants once as \[ C_M=C_\ell+1,\qquad C_{\rm desc}=32(C_\ell+C_w+1). \] Use these constants and $C_w$ in Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer}. These fixed choices determine a cutoff $p_1$, one fixed-tape procedure, and an implicit time constant with the following guarantee. For every choice of positive integers $p,d,r$ with $p\geq p_1$ and \[ a_dp^\epsilon\leq d\leq b_dp^\epsilon,\qquad 2^{a_rp/d}\leq r\leq2^{b_rp/d}, \] suppose $d\geq2$ and $r=2^\ell$ with an integer $2\leq\ell<p$, and require \[ d\ell\leq C_\ell p,\qquad 1\leq K=\lfloor d^c\rfloor\leq\ell-1. \] Let $t_i\in\{2^{\ell-1},2^\ell\}$ for $1\leq i\leq d-1$, put $M=\prod_{i=1}^{d-1}t_i$ and $T=rM$, and let $w$ be an integer with $p+2\leq w\leq C_wp$. The cutoff and time constant are independent of $p,d,r$, these axis choices, the round headers constructed from them, and $w$ within the displayed bounds.
