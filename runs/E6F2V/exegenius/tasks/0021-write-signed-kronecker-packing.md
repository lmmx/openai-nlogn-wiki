# exegenius task 0021-write-signed-kronecker-packing

Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F2V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

## This page

Concept: Signed Kronecker packing of polynomial products
Gloss: Multiplying two polynomial records exactly by evaluating their integer-coefficient parts at a large power of two, multiplying the resulting integers with the established multiplier, and recovering signed coefficients by centered carries.

## This page in the argument

The step: Two ring polynomials in $\mathcal R_r$ are multiplied exactly, and the normalized product $fg/r$ is returned truncated, in $O(rp\log(rp))$ time.
How: evaluate the integer parts of the coefficients at the large power of two $B_0=2^{4p}$, multiply the resulting integers with the established multiplier, and read the signed product coefficients back by centered carries
Why: Integer multiplication is the one fast product available; evaluating at a power of two larger than any coefficient turns a polynomial product into an integer product and the coefficients can be read back digit by digit. (the sources do not say this: give the reader the reason)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Set $B_0=2^{4p}$ and evaluate the real and imaginary integer parts $a,b,c,e$ of the inputs at $B_0$.
- Every coefficient of an ordinary product satisfies $|h_j|\le r2^{2p}<B_0/2$, so centered residues identify them.
- Extract the coefficients block by block with a constant-size carry, using the centered representative modulo $B_0$.
- Combine the real and imaginary streams and reduce modulo $y^r+1$ by subtracting the coefficient at $j+r$ from the one at $j$.
- Four exact integer products dominate the linear packing, extraction and truncation costs.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: start from the Gaussian-resampling reduction of multiplication to transforms, make the transforms cheaper by two tape procedures that each save a power of the logarithm, then recover the product exactly and add up all costs (on [Multiplying n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))
- Normalized convolution over $\mathcal R_r$ on $d-1$ axes, computed from two forward synthetic transforms, pointwise ring products and the opposite transform in the same frequency order, has error $O(M\ell 2^{-p})$ and cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$.; how: transform both operands, multiply pointwise in the retained order, apply the opposite transform, rescale exactly, and bound the errors with the bilinear contraction property (on [Convolution over the polynomial ring from the retained layout](ring-convolution.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S2.2.1, S2.2.2, S2.2.3, S2.2.4, S2.2.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S2.2.1**: Set $B_0=2^{4p}$ and evaluate the real and imaginary integer parts $a,b,c,e$ of the inputs at $B_0$.
Source: "where $a,b,c,e\in\mathbb Z[y]$ have degree less than $r$ and" (paper)
> m:signed-ring-product} Let $r=2^\ell<2^p$ with integers $\ell\geq1$ and $p\geq2$, and fix $C_w>1$. Let $w$ be an integer with $p+2\leq w\leq C_wp$. The input supplies $\Gamma(p)\Gamma(r)\Gamma(w)$ and two disk grid polynomials $f,g\in\mathcal R_r$ in the component format of Proposition~\ref{prop:simultaneous-layer} with width $w$. One can compute the exact Gaussian integer numerators of $fg$, and then return $Q_p(fg/r)$ in that same format, in time $O(rp\log(rp))$ on a fixed number of tapes. The output is a disk grid polynomial with error less than $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$ from $fg/r$. \end{lemma} \begin{proof} The supplied power of two $r$ determines $\ell=\log_2r$. Write \[ f=2^{-p}(a+ib),\qquad g=2^{-p}(c+ie), \] where $a,b,c,e\in\mathbb Z[y]$ have degree less than $r$ and coefficients of absolute value at most $2^p$. Set $B_0=2^{4p}$ and, for $u\in\{a,b,c,e\}$, define the signed evaluation integer \[ A_u=u(B_0)=\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}u_jB_0^j. \] The bound \[ |A_u|\leq2^p\frac{B_0^r-1}{B_0-1}<B_0^r/2 \] shows that each magnitude fits in $4pr$ bits. Multiply the four pairs of absolute values using the established multiplier and restore each product's sign. The resulting integers are $A_aA_c,A_bA_e,A_aA_e,A_bA_c$. For example, if $h=ac$ is the ordinary product in $\mathbb Z[y]$, then \[ A_aA_c=(ac)(B_0)=\sum_{j=0}^{2r-2}h_jB_0^j. \] The other three evaluation products have the same form. Every coefficient in any of these ordinary polynomial products satisfies \begin{

**S2.2.2**: Every coefficient of an ordinary product satisfies $|h_j|\le r2^{2p}<B_0/2$, so centered residues identify them.
Source: "|h_j|\leq r2^{2p}<2^{3p}<B_0/2." (paper)
> oefficients of absolute value at most $2^p$. Set $B_0=2^{4p}$ and, for $u\in\{a,b,c,e\}$, define the signed evaluation integer \[ A_u=u(B_0)=\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}u_jB_0^j. \] The bound \[ |A_u|\leq2^p\frac{B_0^r-1}{B_0-1}<B_0^r/2 \] shows that each magnitude fits in $4pr$ bits. Multiply the four pairs of absolute values using the established multiplier and restore each product's sign. The resulting integers are $A_aA_c,A_bA_e,A_aA_e,A_bA_c$. For example, if $h=ac$ is the ordinary product in $\mathbb Z[y]$, then \[ A_aA_c=(ac)(B_0)=\sum_{j=0}^{2r-2}h_jB_0^j. \] The other three evaluation products have the same form. Every coefficient in any of these ordinary polynomial products satisfies \begin{equation} |h_j|\leq r2^{2p}<2^{3p}<B_0/2. \label{eq:packing-separation} \end{equation} After the lower coefficients have been removed from an evaluation, this strict bound identifies the next coefficient by its centered residue modulo $B_0$.

**S2.2.3**: Extract the coefficients block by block with a constant-size carry, using the centered representative modulo $B_0$.
Source: "Put $\rho_0=0$.  At block $j$, let $\widehat h_j$ be the unique" (paper)
> Now let $Z$ be one of the four signed product integers, and let $h$ be its corresponding ordinary polynomial product. Put $J=2r$ and pad that product by $h_{J-1}=0$. The bound on the evaluation integers gives $|Z|<B_0^J/4$, so $Z$ fits in $J$ blocks of width $4p$. Convert its sign and magnitude to sign-extended two's complement: \[ Z=\sum_{j=0}^{J-1}q_jB_0^j+\varepsilon B_0^J, \qquad 0\leq q_j<B_0,\quad \varepsilon\in\{-1,0\}. \] Zero-fill the unused high blocks; for a negative sign, complement and increment within this fixed width. These conversions take a constant number of scans. Put $\rho_0=0$. At block $j$, let $\widehat h_j$ be the unique integer in $[-B_0/2,B_0/2)$ congruent to $q_j+\rho_j$ modulo $B_0$, and put \[ \rho_{j+1}= \frac{q_j+\rho_j-\widehat h_j}{B_0}. \] The carry belongs to $\{0,1\}$: if $\rho_j$ has this property, then $0\leq q_j+\rho_j\leq B_0$, and centering either leaves this value unchanged or subtracts $B_0$.

**S2.2.4**: Combine the real and imaginary streams and reduce modulo $y^r+1$ by subtracting the coefficient at $j+r$ from the one at $j$.
Source: "The real and imaginary numerator streams are respectively" (paper)
> The real and imaginary numerator streams are respectively $ac-be$ and $ae+bc$. To reduce them modulo $y^r+1$, subtract the coefficient at $j+r$ from the one at $j$ for $0\leq j<r$, treating a missing coefficient as zero. Splitting the two halves to tapes aligns these terms in one further scan. For each first input index $j_1\in\{0,\ldots,r-1\}$, exactly one second index $j_2$ in that range satisfies $j_1+j_2\equiv j\pmod r$. Its sign is positive when $j_1+j_2=j$ and negative when $j_1+j_2=j+r$. Thus each resulting Gaussian integer coefficient $H_j$ is a sum of exactly $r$ signed products of Gaussian integer input coefficients of modulus at most $2^p$. Consequently \[ |H_j|\leq r2^{2p}. \] The same triangle inequality before imposing the disk bound gives $\|fg/r\|_\infty\leq\|f\|_\infty\|g\|_\infty$; in particular the normalized product of disk polynomials lies in the disk. All intermediate coefficient additions fit in $O(p)$ bits. The width-$4p$ packing fields and the exact multiplier output prevent overflow or ambiguity between adjacent fields.

**S2.2.5**: Four exact integer products dominate the linear packing, extraction and truncation costs.
Source: "Four exact integer products dominate the linear" (paper)
> Finally the $p$-bit grid numerator of the normalized product is \[ \operatorname{trunc}_0\left(\frac{\Re H_j}{2^{p+\ell}}\right) +i\operatorname{trunc}_0\left(\frac{\Im H_j}{2^{p+\ell}}\right). \] To implement it, shift the absolute magnitude right by $p+\ell$ bits and restore its sign, at cost $O(p)$ per coefficient. The returned coefficient is $2^{-p}$ times this numerator, namely $Q_p(2^{-2p}H_j/r)$; \eqref{eq:transform-truncate} proves its error and disk bounds. Each returned component numerator has magnitude at most $2^p$, so write it as a signed $w$-bit two's-complement word, most significant bit first, with the real word before the imaginary word and coefficient indices in increasing order. This costs $O(rw)=O(rp)$ and supplies the format used by the opposite transform. Four exact integer products dominate the linear packing, extraction, combination, wrapping, and truncation costs. \end{proof}

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "Signed coefficient packing is a form of Kronecker substitution" (paper)

  > More specifically, the proof adapts Harvey and van der Hoeven's Gaussian-resampling identity, contraction bounds, and short-convolution procedures~\cite[Theorem~4.2, Proposition~4.7 and Lemmas~4.8--4.12]{HarveyHoeven2021}. Their framework already permits arbitrary dimension. Here the source and target permutations remain in the transform identity, while the faster tape procedures perform the required axis movements. Bluestein's conversion to convolution~\cite{Bluestein1970} and the synthetic-root convolution algorithm are retained; the latter follows the polynomial-transform construction in~\cite[Section~2.4 and Section~3]{HarveyHoeven2021}. Signed coefficient packing is a form of Kronecker substitution, with the fixed-tape version of~\cite[Lemma~2.5]{HarveyHoeven2021} as a direct antecedent. Calls to the established $O(n\log n)$ multiplier are ordinary subroutine calls; they do not invoke the improved theorem recursively.

- "Multiply the four pairs of absolute values using the established multiplier and restore each product's sign." (paper)

  > teger numerators of $fg$, and then return $Q_p(fg/r)$ in that same format, in time $O(rp\log(rp))$ on a fixed number of tapes. The output is a disk grid polynomial with error less than $\sqrt2\,2^{-p}$ from $fg/r$. \end{lemma} \begin{proof} The supplied power of two $r$ determines $\ell=\log_2r$. Write \[ f=2^{-p}(a+ib),\qquad g=2^{-p}(c+ie), \] where $a,b,c,e\in\mathbb Z[y]$ have degree less than $r$ and coefficients of absolute value at most $2^p$. Set $B_0=2^{4p}$ and, for $u\in\{a,b,c,e\}$, define the signed evaluation integer \[ A_u=u(B_0)=\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}u_jB_0^j. \] The bound \[ |A_u|\leq2^p\frac{B_0^r-1}{B_0-1}<B_0^r/2 \] shows that each magnitude fits in $4pr$ bits. Multiply the four pairs of absolute values using the established multiplier and restore each product's sign. The resulting integers are $A_aA_c,A_bA_e,A_aA_e,A_bA_c$. For example, if $h=ac$ is the ordinary product in $\mathbb Z[y]$, then \[ A_aA_c=(ac)(B_0)=\sum_{j=0}^{2r-2}h_jB_0^j. \] The other three evaluation products have the same form. Every coefficient in any of these ordinary polynomial products satisfies \begin{equation} |h_j|\leq r2^{2p}<2^{3p}<B_0/2. \label{eq:packing-separation} \end{equation} After the lower coefficients have been removed from an evaluation, this strict bound identifies the next coefficient by its centered residue modulo $B_0$.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0021-write-signed-kronecker-packing.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0021-write-signed-kronecker-packing.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0021-write-signed-kronecker-packing` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0021-write-signed-kronecker-packing`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
