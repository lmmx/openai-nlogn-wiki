# exegenius task 0391-audit-matrix-rank

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Matrix rank

Matrix rank is the number of linearly independent rows of a matrix, over the rational numbers. The paper's matrix shears cost exactly this many interchanges, and that cost saves a power of the chunk width below $n \log n$.

Matrix rank is defined using the vector spaces and linear maps of [Linear algebra basics](linear-algebra-basics.md). Over the rational numbers, the rank of $A$ is the largest number of its rows that are linearly independent. Write $a$ for this count, so $a$ is the number of independent rows of $A$. Row reduction computes it, since each pivot is one independent row. For $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$ the second row is twice the first, so $a = 1$.

Lemma 9 of the paper states that factorization into two invertible lower triangular matrices with a partial permutation matrix between them. Write $E_1$ and $E_2$ for the invertible lower triangular factors, which have zeros above the diagonal. Write $\Pi$ for the partial permutation matrix, which has at most one 1 in each row and column and zeros elsewhere. Then $A = E_1 \Pi E_2$. one, so the number of ones is the rank. Invertible factors do not change rank, and the rows of $\Pi$ holding a one are distinct standard basis vectors. For the example, $E_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 4 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $\Pi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $E_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0.5 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ give $E_1 \Pi E_2 = A$, and $\Pi$ has one 1.

Let $H = (H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_m)$ and $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_m)$ be vectors of $m$ address fields, each field a block of digits, the chunk width. The matrix shear for $A$ sends $(H, D)$ to $(H + AD, D)$. An interchange swaps an $H$ field with a $D$ field. A one at row $s$ and column $\ell$ of $\Pi$ means the update $H_s \leftarrow H_s + D_\ell$, which takes three steps: $D_\ell \leftarrow D_\ell + H_s$, swap $H_s$ with $D_\ell$, then $D_\ell \leftarrow H_s - D_\ell$. On a pair $(\gamma, \delta)$ these give $(\gamma + \delta, \delta)$ with one interchange. The other steps are lower triangular changes of coordinates, which cost linear work. So the shear, and the rank is the cost.

The paper's network has $W$ wires. Each wire carries an [edge change](linear-network-frames.md), and the rank of its matrix gives the cost of that edge change. the total cost of the network. times $m$, this total is below $W m$. The paper's recursion makes, so the [Rank-saving recursion](rank-saving-recursion.md) page turns this count into the saving.
