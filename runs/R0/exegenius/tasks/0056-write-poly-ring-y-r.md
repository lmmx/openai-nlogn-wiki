# exegenius task 0056-write-poly-ring-y-r

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Polynomial ring modulo $y^r+1$
Gloss: Complex-coefficient polynomials in y reduced by y^r = -1, so multiplying by a power of y is a signed shift of the coefficient list and powers of y serve as roots of unity.
Heading: Polynomial ring modulo $y^r+1$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $y$ (ring variable): The polynomial variable whose powers act as roots of unity.
- $r$ (ring degree): The power of two giving the number of coefficients in each polynomial.

## Where the argument relies on this page

- A simultaneous layer of $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ on selected address bits of polynomial-valued arrays costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$, with a single truncation at the end. (on [Fast simultaneous butterfly layers](fast-butterfly-layers.md))
- A phase twist turns the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, whose negative wrap gives the original cyclic wrap after untwisting. (on [Last-coordinate phase twist](phase-twist-convolution.md))
- Synthetic transforms over the polynomial ring need only signed shifts, address rearrangements and butterflies. (on [Synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md))

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow this step: "the coefficient ring in which the root multiplications of the remaining axes become cheap shifts" (The page never says what the remaining axes are or why their root multiplications become shifts in this ring; the claim is not derivable from the page.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Powers of $y$ (cited), and each such root acts on a coefficient list as a signed shift." (The page does not state what the cited source establishes about powers of y, so the reader cannot tell what is being attributed; the link from the cited claim to the page's own signed-shift behaviour is not stated.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- The reader cannot follow this step: "therefore needs only signed shifts, rearrangements of addresses, and additions and subtractions" (No transform over this ring is defined on the page, so the reader cannot check from the page that a transform whose roots are powers of y uses only these operations.). Give the reasoning on this page. If the step rests on a result from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: a citation alone does not explain a step.
- Explain "ideal" in a sentence where it is first used.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 273 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 341 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

The polynomial ring modulo a power-of-two wrap is the ring of complex polynomials in one variable in which the variable's wrap power is identified with $-1$. It is the coefficient ring in which the root multiplications of the remaining axes become cheap shifts.

Let $y$ be the polynomial variable, the ring variable whose powers act as roots of unity. Let $r$ be the ring degree: the number of complex coefficients in each element, a power of two. The ring is written $y^r+1$ and is therefore the polynomial ring modulo $y^r+1$. In the paper, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$ <cite data-source="paper">with $r$ a power of two</cite>.

An element is a polynomial in $y$ of degree below $r$, stored as the list of its $r$ coefficients from $y^0$ up to $y^{r-1}$. Addition is coefficientwise. Multiplication is the ordinary product of polynomials followed by the rule $y^{r+j}=-y^j$ for $0\le j<r$, which replaces every $y^r$ by $-1$. Equivalently, the ring is the quotient $\mathbb{C}[y]/(y^r+1)$ of the polynomial ring by the ideal generated by $y^r+1$.

Multiplying by a power $y^k$ with $0\le k<r$ is a signed shift of the coefficient list: each coefficient moves up $k$ places, and a coefficient pushed past position $r-1$ re-enters at the bottom with its sign reversed. For $r=4$, the list $(1,2,3,4)$ is the polynomial $1+2y+3y^2+4y^3$. Multiplying by $y^3$ gives $y^3+2y^4+3y^5+4y^6=-2-3y-4y^2+y^3$, which is the list $(-2,-3,-4,1)$.

Because $y^r=-1$, we have $y^{2r}=1$ while $y^r\neq 1$, so $y$ is a primitive $2r$-th root of unity in the ring. Powers of $y$ <cite data-source="paper">serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes</cite>, and each such root acts on a coefficient list as a signed shift. A transform over this ring whose roots are powers of $y$ therefore needs only signed shifts, rearrangements of addresses, and additions and subtractions, with no multiplication by a general complex number.
