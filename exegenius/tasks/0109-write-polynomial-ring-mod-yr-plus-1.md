# exegenius task 0109-write-polynomial-ring-mod-yr-plus-1

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1
Gloss: The ring of polynomials with complex coefficients in which y^r is identified with −1, so that y has order 2r and wrap-around flips a sign.
Also called: negacyclic polynomial ring
Heading: Polynomial ring modulo $y^r + 1$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $y$ (polynomial variable): The indeterminate of the polynomial ring, whose powers act as roots of unity.
- $r$ (record length): The number of complex coefficients in a polynomial record, a power of two.

## This page in the argument

The step: One coordinate of the array is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r + 1$, with $r$ a power of two.
How: store one coordinate as polynomial coefficients and use powers of $y$ as roots of unity
Why: Powers of y then serve as roots of unity, so multiplying by such a root is only a signed shift of the coefficient list. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- One coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r + 1$, with $r$ a power of two.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- Exact multiplication of two $n$-bit integers runs in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time on one deterministic fixed-tape machine, with $\kappa = 2^{-182}$.; how: reduce exact multiplication to radix-digit convolution, compute that convolution with fast tape transforms, and check that the output is exact (on [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md))

## Evidence from the sources

- "the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo y r + 1" (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- The reader cannot follow the page's own subject as used here: "The ring is also called the negacyclic polynomial ring" (The name is explained only by contrast with a cyclic wrap-around, which the page does not define or link, so the reader cannot tell what negacyclic means.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "So every element has a unique representative" (The page shows that every polynomial can be reduced to degree less than r but gives no argument that the reduced form is unique. The later claim that y^k is not 1 for 0 < k < r relies on this uniqueness.)
- Say what $z_k$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "where $z_k$ is the $k$-th coefficient of $z$ for $0 \le k < r$"
- Say what $k$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "where $z_k$ is the $k$-th coefficient of $z$ for $0 \le k < r$"
- Say what $m$ denotes where it is first used: the page uses it before saying so in "A root of unity is a number $\omega$ with $\omega^m = 1$ for some positive integer $m$"
- Explain "the argument" inline: its concept depends on this page, so it cannot be a prerequisite.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 516 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 645 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

Here $y$ is the polynomial variable, an indeterminate (a symbol with no numeric value) whose powers act as roots of unity. Here $r$ is the record length, the number of complex coefficients in a polynomial record, which is a power of two.

The polynomial ring modulo $y^r + 1$ is the ring of polynomials with complex coefficients in which $y^r$ is identified with $-1$, so that $y$ has order $2r$ and wrap-around flips a sign. The argument stores one coordinate of its array in this ring, and the [convolution over this ring](polynomial-ring-convolution.md) is the next step built on that storage.

Write $R_r$ for this ring, where $R_r = \mathbb{C}[y]/(y^r+1)$, the polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ with two polynomials identified when they differ by a multiple of $y^r+1$.

In the argument, one coordinate of the array is stored <cite data-source="paper">as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo y r + 1, with r a power of two</cite>. Each element of $R_r$ is a polynomial $z$ with complex coefficients, and a polynomial of any degree is reduced by replacing each power $y^m$ with $m \ge r$ by $-y^{m-r}$. So every element has a unique representative $z = \sum_{k=0}^{r-1} z_k y^k$ of degree less than $r$, where $z_k$ is the $k$-th coefficient of $z$ for $0 \le k < r$, and the list $(z_0, \dots, z_{r-1})$ is the coefficient list of $z$. <cite data-source="paper">We always use representatives of degree less than r.</cite> Addition is coefficientwise.

A root of unity is a number $\omega$ with $\omega^m = 1$ for some positive integer $m$, and the order of $\omega$ is the least such $m$. Since $y^r = -1$, we get $y^{2r} = (-1)^2 = 1$. No smaller positive power of $y$ equals $1$: for $0 < k < r$, $y^k$ is a representative of degree less than $r$ other than $1$, and for $r \le k < 2r$, $y^k = -y^{k-r}$, which is not $1$. So $y$ has order $2r$.

Take $r = 4$. Then $y^4 = -1$, and $z = 1 + 2y$ has coefficient list $(1, 2, 0, 0)$. Multiplying by $y^3$ gives $z\,y^3 = y^3 + 2y^4 = y^3 - 2$, with coefficient list $(-2, 0, 0, 1)$. The coefficient $1$ at position $0$ moves to position $3$, and the coefficient $2$ at position $1$ would move to position $4$, which wraps to position $0$ with its sign reversed.

Here $s$ is the shift amount, the number of positions by which the coefficient list moves, with $0 \le s < r$. Multiplying by $y^s$ therefore moves the coefficient $z_k$ to position $k+s$ when $k+s<r$, and otherwise to position $k+s-r$ with its sign reversed. Powers of $y$ serve as roots of unity here, and <cite data-source="paper">multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the</cite> coefficient list.

The reason for this representation is that the transforms need roots of unity, and powers of $y$ supply them: $y^k$ for $0 \le k < 2r$ are roots of unity of order dividing $2r$. Multiplying a record by one of them moves coefficients and changes some signs, so it costs data movement rather than complex multiplications. The ring is also called the negacyclic polynomial ring, since its wrap-around reverses sign where a cyclic wrap-around would not.

This ring gives the arithmetic for the [synthetic polynomial transforms](synthetic-transforms.md), whose roots of unity are powers of $y$.
