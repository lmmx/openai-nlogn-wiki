Project directory: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user/979e8242-2c77-5242-991d-0bed1baea8dd/scratchpad/e6/F2V` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Exact recovery: scaling, rounding and carries
Gloss: Removing the known normalizations S and 2^{2b+4}, showing the recovered coefficient error is below 1/2 so rounding gives exact convolution coefficients, then propagating radix-2^b carries to the 2n-bit product.

## This page in the argument

The step: After removing the known normalizations $S$ and $2^{2b+4}$, the error in every recovered coefficient is below $1/2$, so rounding gives the exact convolution coefficients, and radix-$2^b$ carries give the $2n$-bit product.
How: bound the accumulated error through each stage by contractions, check it is below $1/2$ after the final scaling, round, and propagate carries with a recurrence whose invariant fixes the digits
Why: The true coefficients are integers, so any error strictly below $1/2$ identifies them uniquely by rounding. (the sources say so: "The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to" (paper))
Striking feature: The final error bound $448\,b\,2^{-3b/4}$ is far below $1/2$ because the working precision $p=6b$ exceeds the scales $2^{2b+4}S\,2^{\gamma}T^2$ by a margin of order $2^{3b/4}$; the loss $2^\gamma$ with $\gamma=o(b)$ is what resampling costs. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Every computed array stays in the disk, and the error of each computed transform adds up predictably: $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$ for the source transform and $E_w<28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L$ after the scaling by $S$.
- The unscaled integer coefficient array is $2^{2b+4}Sw$, where $S$ reverses the normalization of $w$ and $2^{2b+4}$ reverses the two input scales.
- The final absolute error is below $448b\,2^{-b+\gamma}\le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$.
- The nearest integer to each represented coefficient is therefore the exact convolution coefficient, in $[0,2^{3b})$.
- The carries obey $0\le k_j\le q(Q_0-1)<Q_0^2$ with $Q_0=2^b$ and the invariant $\sum_{h<j}c_hQ_0^h=\sum_{h<j}d_hQ_0^h+k_jQ_0^j$.
- The exact product is below $2^{2n}$, so after removing zero padding exactly $2n$ bits remain.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A single deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: start from the Gaussian-resampling reduction of multiplication to transforms, make the transforms cheaper by two tape procedures that each save a power of the logarithm, then recover the product exactly and add up all costs (on [Multiplying n-bit integers in O(n (lg n)^(1−κ)) time](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S5.1, S5.2, S5.3, S5.4, S5.5, S5.6). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S5.1**: Every computed array stays in the disk, and the error of each computed transform adds up predictably: $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$ for the source transform and $E_w<28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L$ after the scaling by $S$.
How: propagate errors through contractions and bilinear contractions, inserting the exact map at the computed input at each step
- S5.1.1: The returned normalized ring convolution has error below $E_{\rm ring}=M(3L+2)<5TL$ in units of $2^{-p}$.
  Source: "less than $3L+2$.  Thus the error of the returned normalized" (paper)
  > For disk-grid ring arrays $f,g$, put $M=T/r$. Two normalized synthetic forwards, pointwise polynomial multiplication divided by $r$, and the normalized opposite transform give $(f*g)/(rM^2)$. The exact multiplication by $M$ in Proposition~\ref{prop:synthetic-convolution} then gives $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/T$. Before that multiplication, the three transform errors and the polynomial-product truncation total less than $3L+2$. Thus the error of the returned normalized convolution is bounded by \[ E_{\rm ring}:=M(3L+2)<5TL. \] If one operand has norm at most $.7$, bilinear contraction gives $\|\mathcal M_r(f,g)\|\le.7$. Its computed grid output consequently has norm less than $.7+5TLh_p<.701$ for large $n$. This proves the disk margin after the scale $M$, without clipping the output.
- S5.1.2: The complex convolution has error below $6TL\,2^{-p}$.
  Source: "<(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p." (paper)
  > To compare it with $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)$, insert the exact normalized $\mathcal M_r$ at $\iota f'$ and $\iota g'$. Its bilinear contraction bound propagates the two input twist errors, each less than $4$. Its approximation contributes $E_{\rm ring}$, and the output untwist contributes less than $4$. All these comparisons are at the normalized $\mathcal M_r$ interface, after its factor $M$. They give \[ \|\widetilde{\mathcal M}_{\mathbb C}(f,g) -\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}(f,g)\| <(E_{\rm ring}+4+4+4)h_p<6TLh_p. \]
- S5.1.3: The chirp transform has error below $8TL\,2^{-p}$.
  Source: "<(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p." (paper)
  > For its error, the exact operands $a$ and $\overline a\cdot x$ are in the disk because every entry of $a$ has modulus one. The kernel approximation contributes less than $2$ and the first endpoint multiplication contributes less than $4$ when inserted into the exact bilinear contraction $\mathcal M_{\mathbb C}$. The computed convolution contributes less than $6TL$, and the last endpoint multiplication less than $4$. Equation~\eqref{eq:permuted-chirp} identifies the exact result, so \[ \|\widetilde{\mathscr C}(x)-QF_{\boldsymbol t}x\| <(6TL+2+4+4)h_p<8TLh_p. \]
- S5.1.4: The source transform has error below $E_s2^{-p}$ with $E_s=9\cdot2^\gamma TL$.
  Source: "E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL," (paper)
  > Finally let the input to a source transform have norm at most $.5$. The computed expansion has error less than $dp^2$ and norm less than $.5+dp^2h_p<.51$. It is therefore a permitted chirp input. The chirp output is in the disk by the preceding argument, so each compression call is defined and returns another disk-grid array. Insert the exact contractions $\mathcal A$, $QF_{\boldsymbol t}$, and $\mathcal B_0$ at the computed inputs. The error before the source scale is less than $2dp^2+8TL$. Multiplication by $2^\gamma$ therefore gives error less than $2^\gamma(2dp^2+8TL)h_p$, which is bounded by $E_sh_p$ with \begin{equation}\label{eq:source-error} E_s=9\,2^\gamma TL, \end{equation} because $2dp^2<TL$ eventually. The exact source transform $RF_{\boldsymbol s}$ is a contraction, so the scaled approximation has norm at most $.5+E_sh_p<.501$. Its exact numerator scaling therefore also leaves a disk-grid output without clipping. Conjugation preserves the grid and norm, so the opposite procedure has the same error and disk guarantee. All these margins may be enforced by one fixed cutoff. For example, $b\ge2^{24}$, together with the other eventual construction conditions, makes $dp^2h_p$, $8TLh_p$, $E_sh_p$ and $28\,2^\gamma T^2Lh_p$ smaller than $10^{-3}$.
- S5.1.5: The product $z=Q_p(\widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1)$ has error below $(2E_s+2)2^{-p}$.
  Source: "Thus $\|z-U\cdot V_1\|<(2E_s+2)h_p$." (paper)
  > The scaled radix digits in $u,v$ are exact $p$-bit grid values of norm strictly less than $1/4$. Put \[ \begin{aligned} U&=RF_{\boldsymbol s}u,&\qquad V_1&=RF_{\boldsymbol s}v,\\ \widetilde U&=\widetilde{\mathscr F}(u),& \widetilde V_1&=\widetilde{\mathscr F}(v). \end{aligned} \] The exact arrays have norm less than $1/4$, and the computed arrays have norm less than $1/4+E_sh_p<.26$. Hence $z=Q_p(\widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1)$ has norm at most $.26^2<.5$. To estimate its error, write \[ \widetilde U\cdot\widetilde V_1-U\cdot V_1 =(\widetilde U-U)\cdot\widetilde V_1 +U\cdot(\widetilde V_1-V_1). \] The factors $\widetilde V_1$ and $U$ are in the disk. The two terms have total norm less than $2E_sh_p$, and truncation adds less than $2h_p$. Thus $\|z-U\cdot V_1\|<(2E_s+2)h_p$.
- S5.1.6: After the opposite transform and the scaling by $S$, $\widetilde w$ approximates $(u*v)/S$ with error below $E_w2^{-p}$, $E_w<28\cdot2^\gamma T^2L$.
  Source: "E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\,2^\gamma T^2L." (paper)
  > Let $G:=RF_{\boldsymbol s}^+$ be the exact opposite contraction. Lemma~\ref{lem:chirp-permutation}, applied to $U=RF_{\boldsymbol s}u$ and $V_1=RF_{\boldsymbol s}v$, gives \[ G(U\cdot V_1)=(u*v)/S^2. \] The computed opposite transform may be applied to $z$ because $\|z\|<.5$. Insert $G$ at that computed input: \[ \begin{aligned} \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-G(U\cdot V_1)\| &\le \|\widetilde{\mathscr F}^{+}(z)-Gz\|\\ &\qquad+\|G(z-U\cdot V_1)\|\\ &<(3E_s+2)h_p. \end{aligned} \] The first exact numerator multiplication by $S$ gives $\widetilde w$, approximating $w=(u*v)/S$ with error less than $E_wh_p$, where \[ E_w:=S(3E_s+2)<28\,2^\gamma T^2L. \] Each coefficient of $w$ is an average of $S$ products of coefficients of $u$ and $v$, so $\|w\|<1/16$. The earlier cutoff therefore gives \[ \|\widetilde w\|<1/16+E_wh_p<1/16+10^{-3}<1. \] This proves the disk bound for the computed first scaled result.

**S5.2**: The unscaled integer coefficient array is $2^{2b+4}Sw$, where $S$ reverses the normalization of $w$ and $2^{2b+4}$ reverses the two input scales.
Source: "In tensor order, the unscaled integer coefficient array is" (paper)
> In tensor order, the unscaled integer coefficient array is $2^{2b+4}S w$. This second occurrence of $S$ reverses the normalization still present in $w$, and $2^{2b+4}$ reverses the two input scales. Both multiplications act exactly on grid numerators. Since $S\le T<2^b$ and $L<b$ eventually, the final absolute error is less than \begin{equation}\label{eq:final-error} 2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\,2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b} <448b\,2^{-b+\gamma} \le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12. \end{equation} The true coefficients are real integers. If $H_j$ is the real numerator after the second scaling, its represented value is $H_j/2^p$. The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to that value the unique correct coefficient.

**S5.3**: The final absolute error is below $448b\,2^{-b+\gamma}\le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<1/2$.
Source: "\le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12." (paper)
> In tensor order, the unscaled integer coefficient array is $2^{2b+4}S w$. This second occurrence of $S$ reverses the normalization still present in $w$, and $2^{2b+4}$ reverses the two input scales. Both multiplications act exactly on grid numerators. Since $S\le T<2^b$ and $L<b$ eventually, the final absolute error is less than \begin{equation}\label{eq:final-error} 2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\,2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b} <448b\,2^{-b+\gamma} \le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12. \end{equation} The true coefficients are real integers. If $H_j$ is the real numerator after the second scaling, its represented value is $H_j/2^p$. The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to that value the unique correct coefficient.

**S5.4**: The nearest integer to each represented coefficient is therefore the exact convolution coefficient, in $[0,2^{3b})$.
Source: "The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to" (paper)
> In tensor order, the unscaled integer coefficient array is $2^{2b+4}S w$. This second occurrence of $S$ reverses the normalization still present in $w$, and $2^{2b+4}$ reverses the two input scales. Both multiplications act exactly on grid numerators. Since $S\le T<2^b$ and $L<b$ eventually, the final absolute error is less than \begin{equation}\label{eq:final-error} 2^{2b+4}S\cdot28\,2^\gamma T^2L\cdot2^{-6b} <448b\,2^{-b+\gamma} \le448b\,2^{-3b/4}<\frac12. \end{equation} The true coefficients are real integers. If $H_j$ is the real numerator after the second scaling, its represented value is $H_j/2^p$. The strict error below $1/2$ makes the nearest integer to that value the unique correct coefficient.

**S5.5**: The carries obey $0\le k_j\le q(Q_0-1)<Q_0^2$ with $Q_0=2^b$ and the invariant $\sum_{h<j}c_hQ_0^h=\sum_{h<j}d_hQ_0^h+k_jQ_0^j$.
Source: "The carries satisfy $0\le k_j\le q(Q_0-1)<Q_0^2$." (paper)
> To propagate carries, let $Q_0=2^b$. The recovered ordinary coefficients are the $c_j$ in \eqref{eq:capacity}; they are zero for $2q-2<j<S$. With $q=\lceil n/b\rceil$ as above, use the recurrence for $0\le j<S$: \[ k_0=0,\qquad d_j=(c_j+k_j)\bmod Q_0,\qquad k_{j+1}=\left\lfloor\frac{c_j+k_j}{Q_0}\right\rfloor. \] The carries satisfy $0\le k_j\le q(Q_0-1)<Q_0^2$. If this holds at $j$, then \[ c_j+k_j\le q(Q_0-1)^2+q(Q_0-1)=qQ_0(Q_0-1), \] which proves the next carry bound. The defining relation $c_j+k_j=d_j+Q_0k_{j+1}$ also gives the exact invariant \[ \sum_{h<j}c_hQ_0^h =\sum_{h<j}d_hQ_0^h+k_jQ_0^j. \] It holds for $j=0$, and the defining relation proves its next instance. The unprocessed terms are multiples of $Q_0^j$, so the identity fixes the first $j$ radix digits of the full product. The value $k_j$ is the carry from the processed coefficients into the remaining positions.

**S5.6**: The exact product is below $2^{2n}$, so after removing zero padding exactly $2n$ bits remain.
Source: "than $2^{2n}$; all bits above position $2n-1$ are therefore zero." (paper)
> After $\Phi^{-1}$ the coefficients occur in increasing ordinary index, so this carry scan proceeds from least to most significant. Carry storage and work per coefficient are $O(b)$ bits and steps. Write each digit's bits from low to high on a work tape, and drain the final $O(b)$-bit carry in the same order. Copy the completed stream backward once to obtain most-significant-first order. The stream has length $O(Sb)=O(Tp)$, including chunk padding and the final carry, so this reversal is a charged linear tape pass. The exact product is less than $2^{2n}$; all bits above position $2n-1$ are therefore zero. Remove only those zero padding bits and retain leading zeros as needed to produce exactly $2n$ bits. Zero inputs obey the same invariant and output rule.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "proves that the recovered coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$, and propagates carries to obtain the exact binary product" (paper)

  > Finally, the source permutation retained during resampling cancels across the two forward source transforms, their pointwise product, and the opposite-sign transform. Section~\ref{sec:assembly} removes the known normalizations and digit scales, proves that the recovered coefficient error is strictly below $1/2$, and propagates carries to obtain the exact binary product. A compatible choice of rational parameters makes all terms in its cost table fit Theorem~\ref{thm:main}. Figure~\ref{fig:multiplication-flow} summarizes these reductions.

- "Propagate radix-$2^b$ carries in increasing coefficient order." (paper)

  > exactly by $S$, retaining the denominator $2^p$ and writing each component in signed width $w_{\rm c}+b$. Denote the represented dyadic array by $\widetilde w$. \item Multiply the grid numerators of $\widetilde w$ exactly by $2^{2b+4}S$, again retaining the denominator $2^p$, and write each component in signed width $w_{\rm c}+4b+4$. Round the represented real values to the nearest integers. At each valid address, write the rounded coefficient in one signed $(3b+1)$-bit word, most significant bit first; at every padded address, write a zero word of that width. Supply this local payload width to $\Phi^{-1}$ and apply it, including removal of the address padding, to restore the ordinary coefficient order. \item Propagate radix-$2^b$ carries in increasing coefficient order. Write the resulting bits from least to most significant on a work tape, then reverse that stream and output exactly $2n$ bits in most-significant-first order. \end{enumerate}

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

```json

```

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-exact-recovery.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-exact-recovery.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0039-write-exact-recovery` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0039-write-exact-recovery`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
