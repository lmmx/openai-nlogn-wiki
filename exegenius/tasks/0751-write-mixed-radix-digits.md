# exegenius task 0751-write-mixed-radix-digits

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

Concept: Mixed-radix digits
Gloss: The digits of an integer written in a positional system whose place values use a separate length for each place, so that the digit at each place ranges over its own length.
Also called: mixed-radix digit, digit

## Where the argument relies on this page

- The radix-digit coefficients are placed on distinct prime cyclic axes by a Chinese-remainder map that preserves convolution. (on [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md))

## Evidence from the sources

- "Every ordinary coefficient index has a unique mixed-radix expression" (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- $s$ means common length here, but first position on [Telescoping identity](telescoping-identity.md), which this page builds on: Different: $s$ means common length on mixed-radix-digits but first position on Telescoping identity. The later page should use another letter for common length, or say explicitly where $s$ keeps this meaning instead of first position.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 609 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 761 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

Mixed-radix digits are the place-value digits of an integer in a positional system where each place has its own length, so the digit at each place ranges over that length rather than over one common base. The [Chinese-remainder map](chinese-remainder-map.md) reads these digits to give each coefficient one coordinate per axis, which requires that each index have exactly one digit tuple. The paper states this fact: <cite data-source="paper">Every ordinary coefficient index has a unique mixed-radix expression</cite>.

Fix a positive integer $\beta$, the number of places, and positive integers $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_\beta$. The place index $j$ runs from $1$ to $\beta$ and names a place. Here $\lambda_j$ is the length of place $j$, the number of values the digit at place $j$ can take. The letters $j$ and $\lambda$ have other meanings on earlier pages; here each has only the meaning given in its definition.

Let $\Lambda = \lambda_1\lambda_2\cdots\lambda_\beta$ be the product of the lengths, the number of distinct digit strings the system can write. The place value of place $j$ is $w_j = \lambda_1\lambda_2\cdots\lambda_{j-1}$, the product of the lengths of the places below it, with $w_1 = 1$. The same formula defines $w_{\beta+1} = \lambda_1\cdots\lambda_\beta = \Lambda$, one place past the last, so $w_j$ is defined for $1 \le j \le \beta+1$.

Let $\nu$ be an integer with $0 \le \nu < \Lambda$, the integer being written. The digit $e_j$ at place $j$ is an integer with $0 \le e_j < \lambda_j$, the digit of the expansion at that place. A mixed-radix expansion of $\nu$ is a tuple (an ordered list) $(e_1, \dots, e_\beta)$ of digits, one per place, such that

$$\nu = \sum_{j=1}^{\beta} e_j\, w_j.$$

For example, take $\beta = 2$, $\lambda_1 = 3$ and $\lambda_2 = 4$. Then $\Lambda = 12$, $w_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = 3$. For $\nu = 7$ the digits are $e_1 = 1$ and $e_2 = 2$, since $1\cdot 1 + 2\cdot 3 = 7$. For $\nu = 11$ they are $e_1 = 2$ and $e_2 = 3$, since $2 + 3\cdot 3 = 11$. If every length is $2$, the place values are powers of $2$ and the expansion is the binary expansion. Here $s$ is the common length, which is also the base, and it counts the digit values $0, \dots, s-1$. If every length equals $s$, the expansion is the base-$s$ expansion.

Every such $\nu$ has exactly one mixed-radix expansion. Here $i$ is a place index that runs over the places below $j$, so the letter changes meaning from its use on the convolution page. Uniqueness of the expansion is based on the [Telescoping identity](telescoping-identity.md): for every place $j$, $\sum_{i<j}(\lambda_i-1)w_i = w_j - 1$, since $(\lambda_i-1)w_i = w_{i+1}-w_i$ and the sum telescopes from $w_1 = 1$.

Suppose two expansions $(e_1,\dots,e_\beta)$ and $(e'_1,\dots,e'_\beta)$ of the same $\nu$ differ, and let $j$ be the largest place where their digits differ. Here $e'_i$ is the digit at place $i$ of the second expansion. Each digit at place $i$ lies in $[0,\lambda_i)$, so $|e_i-e'_i| \le \lambda_i-1$. The digits agree above $j$, so the difference of the two values is $\sum_{i\le j}(e_i-e'_i)w_i$. Since $e_j \ne e'_j$ are integers, the term at $j$ has absolute value at least $w_j$, while the places below $j$ contribute at most $\sum_{i<j}(\lambda_i-1)w_i = w_j-1$. The difference is therefore at least $1$ in absolute value, which contradicts both expansions giving $\nu$. Distinct digit tuples give distinct values.

The largest value a tuple gives comes from $e_j = \lambda_j-1$ at every place. Since $(\lambda_j-1)w_j = w_{j+1}-w_j$, the telescoping identity gives $\sum_j(\lambda_j-1)w_j = w_{\beta+1}-w_1 = \Lambda-1$, using $w_{\beta+1} = \Lambda$. So the $\Lambda$ digit tuples give $\Lambda$ distinct values in $\{0,\dots,\Lambda-1\}$, and every $\nu$ in that range is reached by exactly one tuple.

## Answer

The answer is two files: the page body as markdown (not JSON), and a JSON object with the symbols the page binds and its relations to its prerequisite pages. In JSON strings, write each backslash of LaTeX twice (`"\\kappa"`). The JSON follows this schema:

```json

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0751-write-mixed-radix-digits.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0751-write-mixed-radix-digits.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0751-write-mixed-radix-digits` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.
