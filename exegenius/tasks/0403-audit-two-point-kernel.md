# exegenius task 0403-audit-two-point-kernel

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Two-point kernel

A two-point kernel is the $2\times 2$ operator that acts on the two entries of an array whose addresses differ in one bit. The [simultaneous butterfly layer](simultaneous-butterfly-layer.md) uses such kernels: its phase frames are written as a.

Let $d$ be the number of bits in a binary address. An address is an integer $\nu$ with $0\le\nu<2^d$, whose binary form has $d$ bits. A bit position is an index $e$ with $0\le e<d$, counted from the least significant bit. Write $\oplus$ for bitwise exclusive or, so $\nu\oplus 2^e$ is the address $\nu$ with bit $e$ changed and the other bits kept. Let $\chi$ be an array of complex values, with one entry $\chi(\nu)$ for each address $\nu$.

Here the letter $X$ changes meaning: it is the bit flip $X=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}$, which interchanges the two entries of a pair. Let $\delta$ and $\kappa$ be complex numbers, the coefficients of $I$ and of $X$ in a $2\times 2$ matrix.

We write $K=\delta I+\kappa X$ for the matrix of the two-point kernel. The kernel $K$ is a matrix as defined in [Linear algebra basics](linear-algebra-basics.md). Explicitly,
$$K=\begin{pmatrix}\delta&\kappa\\ \kappa&\delta\end{pmatrix}.$$

The kernel along bit $e$ is the operator $K_e$ that replaces $\chi$ by $K_e\chi$, where
$$(K_e\chi)(\nu)=\delta\,\chi(\nu)+\kappa\,\chi(\nu\oplus 2^e).$$
Equivalently, for every address $\nu$, the pair of entries at $\nu$ and $\nu\oplus 2^e$ is multiplied by $K$:
$$\begin{pmatrix}(K_e\chi)(\nu)\\ (K_e\chi)(\nu\oplus 2^e)\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\delta&\kappa\\ \kappa&\delta\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\chi(\nu)\\ \chi(\nu\oplus 2^e)\end{pmatrix}.$$
All other bits of the address are unchanged, so the kernel acts only along bit $e$.

**Example.** Take $d=1$, so the addresses are $0$ and $1$, and take $\delta=\frac{1+i}{2}$ and $\kappa=\frac{1-i}{2}$. For $\chi(0)=1$ and $\chi(1)=0$, the formula gives $(K_0\chi)(0)=\delta\cdot 1+\kappa\cdot 0=\frac{1+i}{2}$ and $(K_0\chi)(1)=\delta\cdot 0+\kappa\cdot 1=\frac{1-i}{2}$. Applying the kernel twice along the same bit gives $K^2=(\delta^2+\kappa^2)I+2\delta\kappa X$, because $X^2=I$. Here $\delta^2+\kappa^2=\frac{i}{2}-\frac{i}{2}=0$ and $2\delta\kappa=2\cdot\frac{1}{2}=1$, so $K^2=X$. Two applications therefore swap the two entries, which is the bit flip. Check: applying $K$ to $(\delta,\kappa)$ gives $(\delta^2+\kappa^2,\,2\delta\kappa)=(0,1)$, which is $X$ applied to $(1,0)$.

The kernel $K$ has coefficients that are [Gaussian dyadics](gaussian-dyadics.md) when $\delta$ and $\kappa$ are. The kernels used in the paper, so the values computed with them stay exact.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0403-audit-two-point-kernel.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0403-audit-two-point-kernel` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.
