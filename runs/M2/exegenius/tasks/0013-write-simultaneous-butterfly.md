# exegenius task 0013-write-simultaneous-butterfly

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/M2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Reader

Undergraduate computer science: big-O notation, polynomials, complex numbers, basic Turing machines and tapes

For these sources: The reader has an undergraduate computer science education: asymptotic analysis, discrete mathematics with modular arithmetic and primes, introductory linear algebra and probability-free algorithm design (divide and conquer, sorting, recursion with recurrences), complex numbers and polynomials, and basic Turing machines with tapes.

## This page

Concept: Simultaneous butterfly layer in time O(V d^λ′)
Gloss: Applies H0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2) coefficientwise on the same bit in up to d address chunks, using exact Gaussian dyadics and one final truncation.
Heading: Simultaneous butterfly layer in time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $V$ (stored bit volume): The number of stored bits in the arrays.
- $d$ (selected chunk count): The maximum number of equal-width address chunks whose selected bit is transformed together.
- $\lambda'$ (layer exponent): A fixed constant less than 1 giving the power saving.

## This page in the argument

The step: Applying $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ on the same bit in up to $d$ address chunks takes time $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ using exact Gaussian dyadics and one final truncation.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- A deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies two $n$-bit integers exactly in time $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ with $\kappa=2^{-182}$.; how: speed up the tape operations of the transform-based multiplication by a power of the logarithm, then assemble the multiplication (on [Integer multiplication in O(n (lg n)^(1-κ)) on a multitape Turing machine](main-theorem.md))
- Two tape procedures cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ for interchanging address fields of $u$ bits and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a butterfly layer on $d$ chunks, with $\tau,\lambda'<1$, on bit volume $V$.; how: build fixed linear exchange networks with frames and subspaces, then recurse so that the number of smaller calls gives a power saving

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Recursive power saving](recursive-saving.md): Recursion with s calls at parameter f on volume V/W, with s/W < m, yields a power-of-parameter saving over naive passes.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer in time O(V d^λ′) *<predicate>* Recursive power saving
- [Address interchange in time O(V u^τ)](address-interchange.md): Interchanging two disjoint address fields of u bits via XOR combinations of intermediate streams, with exact final permutation.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer in time O(V d^λ′) *<predicate>* Address interchange in time O(V u^τ)
- [Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1](poly-ring.md): Complex polynomials of degree < r with y^r = -1, so multiplying by a power of y is a signed shift of the coefficient list.
  Shown as: Simultaneous butterfly layer in time O(V d^λ′) *<predicate>* Polynomial ring modulo y^r + 1
- [Fixed-point precision and error control](fixed-point-precision.md): Complex values stored on a 2^{-p} grid, with contractive maps, error accumulation and rounding so integer coefficients are recoverable.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a" (paper)

  > The second procedure applies \[ H_0(u,v)=\bigl((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2\bigr) \] simultaneously on selected coordinate bits of the numerical arrays. Each record is a polynomial with complex fixed-point coefficients, and $H_0$ acts coefficientwise. On the layouts used in the multiplication algorithm, one selects the same bit position in each of at most $d$ equal-width address chunks, and the cost is $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for a fixed $\lambda'<1$. Intermediate values are exact Gaussian dyadics, whose real and imaginary parts have power-of-two denominators. A single truncation follows the completed contractive layer. Section~\ref{sec:tape-interchange} proves the address bound, and Section~\ref{sec:fast-butterfly-layers} gives the numerical layout, precision hypotheses, and layer bound.

- "\label{prop:simultaneous-layer}" (paper)

  > \begin{proposition}[Simultaneous normalized butterfly layer] \label{prop:simultaneous-layer} Fix \[ \tau=\sigma=1-2^{-50},\qquad \beta=\frac12,\qquad C_1=20. \] Let $c,\epsilon,\lambda,\lambda'$ be fixed positive rational numbers satisfying \[ \max\{\tau,\sigma\}<\lambda<1,\qquad \tau(1+c/\beta)<\lambda,\qquad \max\{\lambda,\sigma+\beta(1-\sigma)\}<\lambda'<1, \qquad \epsilon C_1<1. \] Fix positive constants $a_d\le b_d$ and $a_r\le b_r$, and fix positive constants $C_M,C_{\rm desc},C_w$ with $C_w>1$. For these fixed choices there are a cutoff $p_0$, one fixed finite-alphabet multitape procedure, and an implicit time constant with the following guarantee. The cutoff and time constant may depend on the fixed rational parameters and these constants. For every choice of positive integers $p,d,r$ with $p\ge p_0$ a

  > \begin{lemma}[Packed selected-bit addition on one rectangle] \label{lem:packed-selected-bit-rectangle} Let $R\ge1$, $K\ge6$, $f\ge1$, $L=fK$, and $0\le\rho<K$. Let $N_0,N_1,N_2,N_3$ be positive integers, and let $(\chi_1,\chi_2,\chi_3)$ be a permutation of $(x,y,z)$. Consider $R$-bit records in lexicographic order on \[ [N_0]\times[2^L]_{\chi_1}\times[N_1]\times[2^L]_{\chi_2} \times[N_2]\times[2^L]_{\chi_3}\times[N_3]. \] The subscript names the chunk at that position. The input supplies $N_0,\ldots,N_3,R,K,f,\rho$ as a fixed number of canonical binary integers, together with the finite permutation of the chunk names, as in Section~\ref{sec:streams}. Put \[ M=2^{3L}\prod_{h=0}^3N_h,\qquad V=MR,\qquad A_{\rm rect}=\lceil\log_2(2V)\rceil. \] At the selected positions $j_i=\

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0013-write-simultaneous-butterfly.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0013-write-simultaneous-butterfly.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0013-write-simultaneous-butterfly` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0013-write-simultaneous-butterfly`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
