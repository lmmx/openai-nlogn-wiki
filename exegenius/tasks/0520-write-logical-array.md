# exegenius task 0520-write-logical-array

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Open with one or two sentences that say what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target (the step of the argument it presents, and the pages that build on it, are listed below), so a reader arriving from a link knows at once why the page matters.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, explain how its method shows its claim. Give the reader every motivation the task marks as not stated by the sources: the sources will not.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, say in a sentence what this page uses it for, and give that sentence as a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence copied exactly. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject and the prerequisite as object: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". If the sentence says "the transforms are reduced by X", the predicate is "reduces its transforms by", not "are reduced to". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"); the sentence must link or name the prerequisite. Pick the predicate that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources: read the parts you need (search for the evidence quotes). State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Back each specific claim taken from a source (a result, a constant, a construction step) with the source text it rests on, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them. Submit rejects text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- Be concrete and specific. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## Evidence from the sources

- "logical array" (paper)

## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.txt`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- Explain "endpoint operator" inline where it is used: "defines the endpoint operator as the operator a network realises" (its concept depends on this page, so it cannot be a prerequisite)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "so that the intermediate changes cancel and the net effect depends only on the endpoints" (The claim that intermediate changes cancel and the net effect depends only on the endpoints is asserted, not shown, and the page does not give the mechanism.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "and the frame relates it to the logical array" (The page announces an equation relating the stored array to the logical array, but the equation is missing, so the reader cannot tell how the stored array is computed from g.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "Along an edge the frame changes but the logical array does not" (Stated without justification or formula. The reader cannot check why the logical array stays the same while the frame changes along an edge.)
- The reader cannot follow this step: "so a route through the network changes only the endpoint frames" (The conclusion that a route changes only the endpoint frames, and the reason the endpoint operator is defined in terms of them, does not follow from anything the page gives.)

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 342 words. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: keep the rewrite within 427 words, a quarter more, unless a problem cannot be fixed without more. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept.

A logical array is an instance of an [Array](array.md) indexed by a common address set: it is the array of values that a role presents to a network, and it is the array that the network's gates compute on. The argument uses it to change how a role's values are stored without changing what the gates compute, so that the intermediate changes cancel and the net effect depends only on the endpoints. The page that builds on this one defines the endpoint operator as the operator a network realises on each role's array once all intermediate frames have cancelled.

The logical array of a role is carried by the [Linear networks and frames](linear-network-frames.md) at that role. A *frame* is an invertible linear operator $D_v$ attached to a vertex $v$ of the network. The stored array is the array actually held at $v$, and the frame relates it to the logical array $g$: <cite data-source="paper">the stored array is Dv g when the logical array is g.</cite>

Along an edge the frame changes but the logical array does not: <cite data-source="paper">the frame changes while the logical array stays fixed</cite>. So the stored array is rewritten at each step while the logical array $g$ stays the same.

A pointwise linear gate combines its input arrays entrywise at each address, with fixed weights $c_1,\dots,c_t$ on its $t$ inputs. When all its inputs share one frame $D_v$, the gate commutes with that frame: <cite data-source="paper">At a pointwise linear gate G, the common frame commutes with the gate:</cite>

$$G(D_v g_1,\dots,D_v g_t)=D_v\,G(g_1,\dots,g_t).$$

Worked example. Take arrays with two entries, and let $D_v$ be the operator that swaps the two entries. It is invertible, and it is its own inverse, so the logical array is recovered from the stored array by applying $D_v$ again. Let the logical inputs of a gate be $g_1=(1,5)$ and $g_2=(2,0)$, and let the gate add its inputs entrywise. Then $G(g_1,g_2)=(3,5)$, and applying $D_v$ gives $(5,3)$. On the stored arrays, $D_v g_1=(5,1)$ and $D_v g_2=(0,2)$, and their entrywise sum is $(5,3)$ as well. The gate therefore gives the same result whether the frame is applied before or after it runs.

<cite data-source="paper">Thus the intermediate frames cancel,</cite> so a route through the network changes only the endpoint frames, which is why the endpoint operator is defined in terms of them.
