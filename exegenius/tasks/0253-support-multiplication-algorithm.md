Check whether each quotation on a page of an explanatory wiki supports the claim it is attached to. Writers back claims taken from the sources with a quotation copied from them; a quotation can exist in the source and still not support what it is attached to.

- Judge each claim against its quotation alone, not against what you know or what the source may say elsewhere.
- `supported`: the quotation states the claim or directly implies it.
- `partial`: the quotation supports part of the claim, or a weaker version of it.
- `unsupported`: the quotation does not address what the claim asserts.
- `contradicted`: the quotation says something incompatible with the claim.
- For every label but `supported`, say in one line what is missing or wrong.
- Label every quotation listed, each once.

Claim: Each stored operand carries $2^{-b-2}$, so $u*v$ carries $2^{-2b-4}$, which the factor $2^{2b+4}$ cancels; $\Phi^{-1}$ then returns the integer digit convolution

Quotation, from Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026): "The second scale gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$, whose inverse image under $\Phi$ is the original integer coefficient convolution."

Paragraph:

> The two scalings by $S$ undo different normalizations: each of $F_{\boldsymbol s}$ and $F_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ carries $1/S$, so $F_{\boldsymbol s}(u*v)=S\,F_{\boldsymbol s}u\cdot F_{\boldsymbol s}v$ and $F_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}F_{\boldsymbol s}$ is the identity divided by $S$; hence $F_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}(F_{\boldsymbol s}u\cdot F_{\boldsymbol s}v)=(u*v)/S^2$. Permutations commute with pointwise products, and $RF_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}R=F_{\boldsymbol s}^{+}$ by [Retained permutation cancellation](retained-permutations.md), so $R$ drops out. Steps 2 to 4 have exact counterpart $(u*v)/S^2$, and after the scale in step 4 it is $w$. Step 5 gives $2^{2b+4}(u*v)$. Each stored operand carries $2^{-b-2}$, so $u*v$ carries $2^{-2b-4}$, which the factor $2^{2b+4}$ cancels; $\Phi^{-1}$ then returns the integer digit convolution.

Write the answer to `exegenius/tasks/0253-support-multiplication-algorithm.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0253-support-multiplication-algorithm` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0253-support-multiplication-algorithm`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
