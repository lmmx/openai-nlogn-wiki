# exegenius task 0028-write-main-theorem

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Integer multiplication in O(n(lg n)^{1-κ}) time
Gloss: Deterministic fixed-tape Turing machine multiplying n-bit integers in O(n(lg n)^{1-κ}), κ=2^{-182}, by reducing to ring convolution with fast address interchanges and simultaneous butterfly layers, disproving the n log n conjecture in this model.
Heading: Integer multiplication in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time

The symbols in this page's heading denote (say so on the page):

- $n$ (input length): The number of bits in each integer being multiplied.
- $\kappa$ (saving exponent): The fixed constant 2^{-182} giving the power saving in the logarithmic factor.

## This page in the argument

The step: An $n$-bit integer product is computed by a fixed-tape machine in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ time, $\kappa=2^{-182}$.
How: reduce multiplication to ring convolution and speed up its address moves and butterfly layers
Why: The n log n cost comes from moving data and applying butterflies at every transform level, so faster versions of exactly these operations lower the whole bound. (the sources leave this for the reader to work out: spell it out)
Striking feature: The logarithmic factor drops by a fixed power $\kappa$, strictly below the conjectured $n\log n$. (explain why it holds, from the method)

Its sub-steps, in order:

- Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces the integer product to a convolution of short integer coefficients. (on [Reduction of integer product to digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md))
- Two fixed-tape procedures, an address interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for fixed exponents below 1, where $V$ is the stored bit volume.
- The radix-digit coefficient list is placed on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a convolution-preserving Chinese-remainder map. (on [Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes](crt-address-map.md))
- Gaussian resampling expresses each source Fourier transform through a power-of-two tensor transform. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform into normalized cyclic convolution. (on [Bluestein's chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md))
- A phase twist turns the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, whose negative wrap gives the original cyclic wrap after untwisting. (on [Last-coordinate phase twist](phase-twist-convolution.md))
- Convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ on the remaining axes is computed by synthetic transforms and packed polynomial products. (on [Convolution with retained transform order and cancelled permutations](ring-convolution-retained-order.md))
- Known rescalings and rounding recover the coefficients since the error is below $1/2$, and carry propagation gives the exact product. (on [Fixed-point precision and exact recovery](fixed-point-precision.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S1). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S1**: Two fixed-tape procedures, an address interchange and a simultaneous butterfly layer, cost $O(Vu^\tau)$ and $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ for fixed exponents below 1, where $V$ is the stored bit volume.
How: build both procedures from one finite linear network and a recursion that saves a power

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S2 (on [Reduction of integer product to digit convolution](radix-digit-reduction.md)): Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces the integer product to a convolution of short integer coefficients.
- S3 (on [Chinese-remainder map to prime cyclic axes](crt-address-map.md)): The radix-digit coefficient list is placed on a product of distinct prime cyclic axes by a convolution-preserving Chinese-remainder map.
- S4 (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md)): Gaussian resampling expresses each source Fourier transform through a power-of-two tensor transform.
- S5 (on [Bluestein's chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md)): Bluestein's chirp identity converts the middle transform into normalized cyclic convolution.
- S6 (on [Last-coordinate phase twist](phase-twist-convolution.md)): A phase twist turns the last cyclic coordinate into a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, whose negative wrap gives the original cyclic wrap after untwisting.
- S7 (on [Convolution with retained transform order and cancelled permutations](ring-convolution-retained-order.md)): Convolution over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ on the remaining axes is computed by synthetic transforms and packed polynomial products.
- S8 (on [Fixed-point precision and exact recovery](fixed-point-precision.md)): Known rescalings and rounding recover the coefficients since the error is below $1/2$, and carry propagation gives the exact product.
- S1.1 (on [Finite linear network with roles and frames](linear-network-roles.md)): Each procedure comes from a fixed linear network that exchanges two banks of values with prescribed signs and restores every auxiliary value; rows are distributed among $W$ roles and frames cancel along routes.
- S1.2 (on [Fast interchange of address fields](fast-address-interchange.md)): Two disjoint contiguous $u$-bit address fields can be interchanged in $O(Vu^\tau)$ for a fixed $\tau<1$, although the intermediate steps are XOR combinations.
- S1.3 (on [Fast simultaneous butterfly layers](fast-butterfly-layers.md)): A simultaneous layer of $H_0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2)$ on selected address bits of polynomial-valued arrays costs $O(Vd^{\lambda'})$ with $\lambda'<1$, with a single truncation at the end.
- S1.4 (on [Three-element subset intersection construction](subset-intersection-construction.md)): The network is built from three-element subsets with gather, scatter and cancelling auxiliary wires, so that the total number $s$ of smaller calls satisfies $s<Wm$.
- S1.5 (on [Recursive power saving from s<Wm](recursive-power-saving.md)): A recursive call at parameter $mf$ uses $s$ calls at parameter $f$ on streams of volume $V/W$, so the volume-normalized cost grows as a power, giving a fixed power saving.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Fast interchange of address fields](fast-address-interchange.md): Interchange two disjoint contiguous u-bit address fields in an array in O(V u^τ) for fixed τ<1, via XOR combinations that end as an exact permutation.

- [Fast simultaneous butterfly layers](fast-butterfly-layers.md): Applies H0(u,v)=((u+v)/2,(u-v)/2) on selected address bits of polynomial-valued arrays with exact Gaussian dyadics in O(V d^λ') with λ'<1, one truncation at the end.
  Shown as: Integer multiplication in O(n(lg n)^{1-κ}) time *<predicate>* Fast simultaneous butterfly layers
- [Convolution with retained transform order and cancelled permutations](ring-convolution-retained-order.md): Two forward synthetic transforms keep the same frequency order through the pointwise product, and the opposite transform consumes it, so retained permutations cancel without separate sorts.

- [Fixed-point precision and exact recovery](fixed-point-precision.md): Complex fixed-point coefficients; bounding error below 1/2 so rounding recovers exact integer coefficients and carry propagation yields the product.
