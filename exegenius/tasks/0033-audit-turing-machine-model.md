# exegenius task 0033-audit-turing-machine-model

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

A term, symbol or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term, symbol or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- symbol: notation used without being defined on the page.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list if the reader can follow the whole page.

# Multitape Turing machine

A multitape Turing machine in this paper has one fixed finite alphabet and one fixed finite number of one-dimensional tapes. Each tape has its own head. In one step, the machine reads and writes at most one cell on each tape, and moves each head by at most one cell.

The model is the standard one for measuring bit complexity. Its running time is the number of steps. Using fixed tracks or a fixed number of work tapes changes the time by a constant factor, so these choices do not affect the bounds that matter here.

The paper distinguishes two kinds of rearrangement of data on tape. Moving one digit of a fixed radix to another position takes a bounded number of scans of the data. Interchanging two fields whose numbers of digits grow is much more expensive, and it is the subject of the [address-field interchange](address-interchange.md) procedure.

For example, consider an array of volume $V$, the number of stored data bits. Moving one specified radix-$q$ digit to another position, while preserving the order of the other positions, takes $O(V)$ steps. This is a linear-time operation on the whole array, which is the kind of cost the paper's later bounds are built from.

Counting also has a cost in this model. A binary counter over $L$ consecutive counts costs $O(L + w)$ time, where $w$ is its width, because the low-order positions change more often than the high-order ones.
