# exegenius task 0159-write-fourier-transform

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Discrete Fourier transform
Gloss: The map sending a length-n sequence to its values at the n-th roots of unity, i.e. the sums of the sequence weighted by powers of a root of unity.
Also called: Fourier transform, DFT, transform of length n

## Where the argument relies on this page

- A Fourier transform of prime length is a multidimensional transform whose axis lengths are powers of two. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- The middle transform, with its target permutation, becomes normalized cyclic convolution. (on [Bluestein's chirp identity](bluestein-chirp.md))

## Symbols already bound on earlier pages

The symbols in the names of the concepts the reader knows are listed with those concepts above.

- $n$ (input bit length), bound on [Schönhage–Strassen n log n conjecture](nlogn-conjecture.md): The number of bits in each input integer; the count of bits in one operand.
- $\kappa$ (exponent gap), bound on [Schönhage–Strassen n log n conjecture](nlogn-conjecture.md): A fixed positive constant, the gap $\kappa = 2^{-182}$ in the exponent of the logarithm.
- $\kappa$ (exponent gap), bound on [Harvey–van der Hoeven O(n log n) multiplication](harvey-hoeven-multiplier.md): A fixed positive constant, $2^{-182}$, by which the logarithmic exponent of the target running time falls below 1.
- $n$ (root order), bound on [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md): The order of the root, a positive integer that counts the positions of the transform it labels.
- $\omega$ (primitive root), bound on [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md): A primitive $n$-th root of unity, the complex number that labels the positions of a transform.
- $k$ (power exponent), bound on [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md): An integer exponent of the root, marking which power of $\omega$ is meant.
- $j$ (earlier exponent), bound on [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md): An integer exponent of the root, the smaller of two powers compared in the distinctness argument.

## Prerequisite pages (link each on first use, exactly as written, and give a relation for each)

- [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md): A complex number ω is a primitive n-th root of unity when ω^n = 1 and no smaller positive power equals 1.
  Shown as: Discrete Fourier transform *<predicate>* Primitive roots of unity

## Pages that build on this one

- Butterfly operation: The two-point map (u, v) ↦ ((u + v)/2, (u − v)/2) applied to a pair of values, the basic step of a fast transform.
- Synthetic polynomial transform: A transform over a polynomial ring in which the roots of unity are powers of y, so that each transform stage uses only signed shifts and butterfly additions.
- Gaussian resampling: An identity that expresses a Fourier transform of length given by a prime as a multidimensional transform with power-of-two axis lengths, with the source and target permutations kept in the identity.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for" (paper)

  > Splitting the inputs into radix digits reduces multiplication to convolution of short integer coefficients. Our starting point is the Gaussian-resampling reduction of Harvey and van der Hoeven \cite{HarveyHoeven2021}: it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for this convolution by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. After a further conversion to convolution, one coordinate is stored as the coefficient list of a polynomial modulo $y^r+1$, with $r$ a power of two. Powers of $y$ then serve as roots of unity in the remaining axes, and multiplication by such a root is a signed shift of the coefficient list. These are the synthetic polynomial transforms of Nussbaumer and Quandalle and Nussbaumer~\cite{NussbaumerQuandalle1978,Nussbaumer1980}.


## Sources (read from disk as needed)

- `sources/paper.tex`: source id `paper`, "Integer multiplication below n log n (OpenAI, 2026)"

## Problems a reader audit found in the previous version (fix all of them)

- $j$ means input index here, but earlier exponent on [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md), which this page builds on: On fourier-transform, the input index j clashes with the root exponent j of roots-of-unity. Use another letter for the input index (e.g. i), since j is the exponent of the root on the earlier page.
- $k$ means output index here, but power exponent on [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md), which this page builds on: On fourier-transform, the output index k clashes with the root exponent k of roots-of-unity. Use another letter for the output index (e.g. h), since k is the exponent of the root on the earlier page.

## Previous version (revise it)

It has 214 words, not counting mathematics and citations. Fix the problems by restructuring rather than appending: submit rejects a rewrite over 267 words. Pages that grow with every repair stop being self-contained explanations of one concept. Submit also rejects letters in the mathematics that the previous version did not use, unless the symbols they make are bound: a new formula brings new symbols for the reader to learn.

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT, also called the Fourier transform) is the map that sends a sequence to its values at the roots of unity of the same length. The multiplication argument needs such transforms for a convolution: Gaussian resampling replaces them by multidimensional transforms whose axis lengths are powers of two. <cite data-source="paper">it replaces the Fourier transforms needed for</cite>

The input sequence is $a = (a_0, \dots, a_{n-1})$, a list of complex numbers, where $n$ is its length. The transform is defined using [Primitive roots of unity](roots-of-unity.md): fix a primitive $n$-th root of unity $\omega$. Here $j$ indexes the input entries and runs from $0$ to $n-1$. Here $k$ indexes the output entries and runs over the same range, not the power index of the roots-of-unity page.

The output sequence is $\hat a = (\hat a_0, \dots, \hat a_{n-1})$, with entries given by the formula below.

$$\hat a_k = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j\,\omega^{jk}, \qquad k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1.$$

Each entry is a polynomial evaluation. Let $p(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j$ be the polynomial whose coefficient list is $a$, where $x$ is a formal variable, a placeholder for a number to be substituted, and $a_j$ is the coefficient of $x^j$. Substituting $x = \omega^k$ gives $p(\omega^k) = \hat a_k$.

Because $\omega$ is primitive, its powers $\omega^0,\dots,\omega^{n-1}$ are distinct, so they are all $n$ roots of $x^n = 1$. Hence $\hat a$ lists $p$ at every $n$-th root of unity.

Example. For $n = 2$, $\omega = -1$ is primitive, and $\hat a_0 = a_0 + a_1$, $\hat a_1 = a_0 - a_1$. For $a = (3, 1)$ this gives $\hat a = (4, 2)$.

Term by term, the formula takes about $n^2$ multiplications, since each of the $n$ entries is a sum of $n$ products.
