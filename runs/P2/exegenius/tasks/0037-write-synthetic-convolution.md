# exegenius task 0037-write-synthetic-convolution

Project directory: `/home/user/openai-nlogn-wiki/runs/P2` (paths below are relative to it)

Write one page of an explanatory wiki. The wiki explains a target result from source documents to a specific reader, one concept per page, in reading order.

- Write for this reader's next uncertainty: at each point, give what they need to follow, and no more. The task lists the step of the argument this page presents, its motivations, and the pages around it. They are material for deciding what to say, not a list to cover: explain the transitions this reader would find hard, and leave familiar ones to ordinary sentences.
- Open with a sentence that says what the concept is and what it is for on the way to the target.
- If the page presents a step of the argument, say how its method shows its claim, and give its main motivation in a sentence. Add another motivation only if the reader would be stuck without it.
- Explain the page's concept so that this reader can follow it using only what they already understand (listed below), what this page itself explains, and the linked prerequisite pages.
- Define any other technical term on this page, where it is first used.
- Say what each symbol denotes where you introduce it: what it stands for, and for a size or count, what it counts ("$r$, the number of complex coefficients in a record", not "a power of two $r$"). A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") does not say what $r$ denotes. Symbols listed as already bound can be used without restating them: the page shows the reader their meanings. Using one of those letters with another meaning confuses readers: pick another letter, or say on the page that the letter changes meaning here.
- Link each prerequisite page the first time you rely on it, using the exact markdown link given. You may also link the other pages listed. Submit rejects links to anything else in the wiki; external URLs are allowed.
- For each prerequisite page, give a relation: the prerequisite's id, a predicate, and the sentence that links or names it, copied exactly. Use the sentence where the page relies on it; do not add a sentence for the purpose. The page shows the relation as "<this page's concept> *<predicate>* <prerequisite>", so pick a predicate that makes that a true sentence, with this page's concept as subject: "is reduced to", "computes its transforms by", "is based on", "follows from", "bounds the cost of". Build the predicate from the sentence's own words (other forms of a word count: "reduces" for "reduced"), and pick one that says what the prerequisite does for this page: "uses" says little.
- Stay accurate to the sources. The paragraphs around the evidence are given below; read further in the sources only if they are not enough. State only what the sources support or what is standard background; do not invent results, constants or attributions.
- Cite the results and constants a reader may want to check, right after the claim: `<cite data-source="id">text copied word for word from that source</cite>`. Readers see these as "(see p. 5)"-style references, hidden until they ask for them, so the sentence must read complete without the quoted words: write "the cost is $O(n \log n)$ <cite …>…</cite>", not "the paper states the cost as <cite …>…</cite>". Submit rejects a citation right after "that", "as", "states", "says", "is", "gives", "reads" or a colon, and text not found in the named source. Do not cite common background.
- A citation says where a claim comes from; it does not explain it. If the page's concept is an identity, a construction or a definition, state it. Explain how the concept works and how it shows its claim. For a result the page uses from prior work, say what the result states and why it applies here, and cite the source for its proof: the page need not reproduce it.
- Keep the page short. The task gives its word limit, counted without mathematics and citations, and submit rejects a longer page. Give a small worked example where it makes the idea clearer. No filler, no rhetorical flourishes, no announcing what the page will do.
- Write mathematics in LaTeX: $...$ inline, $$...$$ on its own lines for display.
- Do not write a title heading, a prerequisites list or a sources section: those are added automatically. Use ## subheadings only if the page is long.

## This page

Concept: Convolution over the polynomial ring from the retained transform layout
Gloss: Normalized convolution M_r(f,g) = (f*g)/(rM): two forward synthetic transforms, pointwise ring products by signed packing in the retained stored order, and the opposite transform, with error below √2·M(3ℓ+1)·2^{−p}.

## This page in the argument

The step: Normalized convolution $\mathcal M_r(f,g)=(f*g)/(rM)$ over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ of arrays on $M=T/r$ cyclic addresses with disk grid values can be computed with error below $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$ in time $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$.
How: Perform two forward synthetic transforms whose rounds use the simultaneous butterfly layer on a chunked layout, multiply the transforms pointwise in the retained stored order by signed packing, and apply the opposite transform
Why: Synthetic roots of unity $y^{2r/t}$ turn twiddle factors into signed shifts, so the whole transform consists of butterflies that the fast layer accelerates, plus polynomial products, which are small enough to use the established multiplier. (the sources say so: "The work here is to apply the simultaneous layers on a suitable tape" (paper))

Its sub-steps, in order:

- The synthetic transform over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ with roots $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$ is computed by butterflies $H_0$ and twiddles that are signed shifts, and it leaves the entry $(F_t^-z)_j$ in the bit-reversed slot $\operatorname{rev}_a(j)$. (on [Synthetic polynomial transform](synthetic-transform.md))
- A layout permutation $L$ built from prefix-slot moves and $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges puts the selected bits of all axes at a common offset of consecutive $K$-bit chunks, so each transform round is one simultaneous layer, at total cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$. (on [Transform layout on which parallel layers apply](synthetic-transform-layout.md))
- Pointwise multiplication commutes with applying the same record permutation $LB$ to both operands, so the forward outputs can be multiplied in the retained order and passed straight to the opposite procedure.
- Evaluating integer polynomials at $B_0=2^{4p}$, multiplying them with the established multiplier, and extracting signed coefficients by centered residues multiplies ring elements of $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ in $O(rp\log(rp))$ time. (on [Signed packing of polynomial products (Kronecker substitution)](signed-packing.md))
- Two forward transforms in the common $LB$ order, the pointwise ring products and the opposite transform followed by an exact scaling by $M$ give $\mathcal M_r$ within the stated error and cost.

It serves these steps, from the main result down:

- One deterministic multitape Turing machine multiplies $n$-bit integers exactly in $O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ worst-case time with $\kappa=2^{-182}$, refuting the $n\log n$ optimality conjecture in this model.; how: Build two fast tape procedures (address interchange and simultaneous butterfly layers), run them inside synthetic transforms, reduce integer multiplication to such a convolution by resampling, chirps and a Chinese-remainder layout, then check precision and total up the time (on [Power-saving integer multiplication theorem](main-theorem.md))

## Steps this page derives

The argument gives this page these sub-steps of its step (S3.3, S3.5). Derive each here, so the reader can check how it follows from what comes before: stating its result, or citing the source for it, does not derive it. The passages report each step in the source; they ground the derivation and are not to be copied onto the page. In `derivations`, give each step's id and the passage on the page that derives it, copied exactly: submit checks that the passage is on the page, and the audit judges whether it is enough.

**S3.3**: Pointwise multiplication commutes with applying the same record permutation $LB$ to both operands, so the forward outputs can be multiplied in the retained order and passed straight to the opposite procedure.
Source: "Pointwise multiplication commutes with applying the same record" (paper)
> Pointwise multiplication commutes with applying the same record permutation $LB$ to both operands. We may therefore multiply the forward outputs in their retained order and pass that order directly to the opposite procedure. The following polynomial product implements this operation with an established integer multiplier.

**S3.5**: Two forward transforms in the common $LB$ order, the pointwise ring products and the opposite transform followed by an exact scaling by $M$ give $\mathcal M_r$ within the stated error and cost.
Source: "Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order." (paper)
> \begin{proposition}[Convolution from the retained transform layout] \label{prop:synthetic-convolution} Under the hypotheses of Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost}, $\mathcal M_r$ on disk grid operands has an approximation with error less than \begin{equation} \sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p} \label{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} \end{equation} and cost \[ O\left(Tp\left[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'} +\log(rp)\right]\right). \] Put $m_M=\log_2M$ and $w_M=w+m_M$. The returned grid array is in the original array and coefficient order, with the same two's-complement component format at width $w_M$. The procedure supplies $\Gamma(w_M)$ on the output descriptor tape, so the caller knows every component boundary from this width and the retained shape parameters. If one operand has norm at most $\rho<1$ and the bound in \eqref{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} is at most $1-\rho$, the returned grid array is a disk array. \end{proposition} \begin{proof} Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order. Pass the supplied $p,r,w$ to Lemma~\ref{lem:signed-ring-product} for corresponding polynomial records. Its output keeps that record order and uses the component format required by the opposite procedure. Apply the opposite procedure to that order, and multiply its result exactly by $M=T/r$.

### Steps derived on other pages

Where this page uses one, state its result and link the page that derives it. Do not derive it here, even where a passage above proves it.

- S3.1 (on [Synthetic polynomial transform](synthetic-transform.md)): The synthetic transform over $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ with roots $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$ is computed by butterflies $H_0$ and twiddles that are signed shifts, and it leaves the entry $(F_t^-z)_j$ in the bit-reversed slot $\operatorname{rev}_a(j)$.
- S3.2 (on [Transform layout on which parallel layers apply](synthetic-transform-layout.md)): A layout permutation $L$ built from prefix-slot moves and $O(p/K)$ chunk exchanges puts the selected bits of all axes at a common offset of consecutive $K$-bit chunks, so each transform round is one simultaneous layer, at total cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$.
- S3.4 (on [Signed packing of polynomial products (Kronecker substitution)](signed-packing.md)): Evaluating integer polynomials at $B_0=2^{4p}$, multiplying them with the established multiplier, and extracting signed coefficients by centered residues multiplies ring elements of $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ in $O(rp\log(rp))$ time.

## Evidence from the sources, with the paragraph around each quote

- "\mathcal M_r(f,g)=\frac{f*g}{rM}=\frac{f*g}{T}" (paper)

  > For arrays on $\prod_i\mathbb Z/t_i\mathbb Z$ with values in $\mathcal R_r$, let $*$ denote cyclic convolution in the displayed axes and define \[ \mathcal M_r(f,g)=\frac{f*g}{rM}=\frac{f*g}{T}. \] For a fixed output coefficient, each of the $M$ first cyclic addresses determines one second address, and each of the $r$ first polynomial indices determines one second index modulo $r$. The negacyclic wrap supplies the sign. Thus that coefficient averages $rM$ signed scalar products, and $\mathcal M_r$ is a bilinear contraction: \[ \|\mathcal M_r(f,g)\|_\infty \leq\|f\|_\infty\|g\|_\infty. \] If the other operand is a disk array, replacing one operand changes the output by at most the norm distance between its two values.

- "Convolution from the retained transform layout" (paper)

  > \begin{proposition}[Convolution from the retained transform layout] \label{prop:synthetic-convolution} Under the hypotheses of Lemma~\ref{lem:synthetic-transform-cost}, $\mathcal M_r$ on disk grid operands has an approximation with error less than \begin{equation} \sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p} \label{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} \end{equation} and cost \[ O\left(Tp\left[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'} +\log(rp)\right]\right). \] Put $m_M=\log_2M$ and $w_M=w+m_M$. The returned grid array is in the original array and coefficient order, with the same two's-complement component format at width $w_M$. The procedure supplies $\Gamma(w_M)$ on the output descriptor tape, so the caller knows every component boundary from this width and the retained shape parameters. If one operand has norm at most $\rho<1$ and the bound in \eqref{eq:synthetic-convolution-error} is at most $1-\rho$, the returned grid array is a disk array. \end{proposition} \begin{proof} Perform both forward transforms and retain their common $LB$ order. Pass the supplied $p,r,w$ to Lemma~\ref{lem:signed-ring-product} for corresponding polynomial records. Its output keeps that record order and uses the component format required by the opposite procedure. Apply the opposite procedure to that order, and multiply its result exactly by $M=T/r$.

Write the body to `exegenius/tasks/0037-write-synthetic-convolution.answer.md` and the JSON to `exegenius/tasks/0037-write-synthetic-convolution.answer.json`, then run `exegenius submit 0037-write-synthetic-convolution` in the project directory. If submit rejects the answer, fix the answer and submit again.

Keep any other files you make, such as scripts, in `exegenius/tasks/0037-write-synthetic-convolution`. Other tasks run at the same time on this machine, and files elsewhere (in /tmp, for example) can be overwritten or run by them. For the same reason, never stop processes by name or pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), which would stop other tasks' commands too: stop a command of your own by its process id.
