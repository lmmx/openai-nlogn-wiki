# exegenius task 0162-audit-n-log-n-conjecture

Project directory: `/mnt/openai-nlogn` (paths below are relative to it)

Audit one page of an explanatory wiki on behalf of a specific reader. Use only this task file: do not read the sources, other pages or any other file.

The reader knows exactly the concepts listed as known, together with what the reader profile states. Everything else that you know, the reader does not know: treat it as unknown to them, however elementary it seems to you. You are simulating that reader's lack of knowledge, so use your own knowledge only to recognise what the reader is missing.

Symbols: account for every symbol in the page's mathematics, each once, saying where the reader learns what it denotes:
- `here`: the page says what it denotes; quote the sentence that says it. A use in an example ("take $r = 4$") or a range ("a power of two $r$") does not say what $r$ denotes or counts. If the page uses the symbol before that sentence, submit records that the meaning comes too late.
- `page`: an earlier page binds it, as listed under "Symbols bound on earlier pages".
- `concept`: the name of a known concept contains it and binds it, as listed under that concept. A symbol in a known concept's name that is listed with no meaning is not known.
- `background`: standard notation the reader profile covers; say what covers it.
- `unbound`: nothing tells the reader what it denotes.
Submit checks that each symbol is in the page's mathematics, that each quote is on the page and contains the symbol, and that the named page or concept binds it.

Terms and steps: a term or step is followable if the reader knows it, the page explains it, or the page links it to another wiki page. Report every term or step on the page that the reader cannot follow:
- term: a named concept the reader does not know, which the page neither explains nor links.
- step: an inference, calculation or claim the reader cannot check from what the page gives.

Copy each quote from the page exactly, character for character, and keep it short: submit rejects quotes it cannot find on the page. Do not report anything the reader can follow. Answer with an empty list of gaps if the reader can follow the whole page.

# The n log n optimality conjecture

The n log n optimality conjecture says that $n \log n$ is the optimal order of growth of the time needed to multiply two integers. Here $\log$ is the base-2 logarithm; changing the base multiplies $n \log n$ by a constant, which leaves the order of growth unchanged. The main theorem of this wiki, [Integer multiplication below n log n](main-theorem.md), refutes the conjecture, so this page states exactly what is refuted.

The conjecture bounds the cost of [exact integer multiplication](exact-integer-multiplication.md) from below. Schönhage and Strassen proved in 1971 that two $n$-bit integers can be multiplied in time on a multitape Turing machine, and they. Harvey and van der Hoeven later established an, so $n \log n$ is achievable, and the conjecture says that nothing of smaller order is.

The conjecture is stated for a fixed model, because a lower bound on running time must refer to one machine. The model is of one-dimensional tapes, so neither the alphabet nor the number of tapes grows with the input length.

Let $A$ be one fixed Turing machine that computes exact products, and let $T_A(n)$ be its worst-case running time: the largest number of steps $A$ takes over all pairs of $n$-bit integers. Write $\lg n = \max\{\lceil \log_2 n\rceil, 1\}$ for the base-2 logarithm of $n$ rounded up to an integer, and never below $1$.

The conjecture says that for every such machine $A$ there are constants $c_A > 0$ and $N_A$ such that the following holds.

$$T_A(n) \ge c_A\, n \lg n \quad \text{for all } n \ge N_A.$$

In the paper, this inequality for each fixed machine.

The negation of the conjecture is that some machine $A$ has, for every $c > 0$ and every $N$, some $n \ge N$ with $T_A(n) < c\, n \lg n$. The conjecture is negated through the [limit inferior](limit-inferior.md) of $T_A(n)/(n\lg n)$, which must be zero for some machine $A$. The limit inferior, written $\liminf_{n\to\infty}$, is the smallest value a sequence approaches infinitely often. For nonnegative terms it is zero exactly when the sequence falls below every $c > 0$ infinitely often, which is the negation above. The paper writes it as $\liminf_{n\to\infty} T_A(n)/(n\lg n) = 0$.

The gap between these growth rates is large. Take $n = 1024$ and $n = 2048$. Then $\lg n = 10$ and $\lg n = 11$, so $n \lg n$ grows from $10240$ to $22528$, a factor of $2.2$ when $n$ doubles. Schoolbook multiplication, which takes on the order of $n^2$ steps, grows by a factor of $4$.

The main theorem gives one fixed machine with $T_A(n) = O(n(\lg n)^{1-\kappa})$ for a specific constant $\kappa > 0$. Since $(\lg n)^{-\kappa} \to 0$, the ratio $T_A(n)/(n\lg n)$ tends to zero, so its limit inferior is zero, which is the negation above. The paper states that its algorithm optimality conjecture of Schönhage and Strassen in this model.
